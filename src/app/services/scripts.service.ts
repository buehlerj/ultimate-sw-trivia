The two struggle in a test of strength, the two energy blades straining against each other. Dooku wins the test and runs his blade through Obi-Wan's shoulder. The younger Jedi screams in agony and drops his blade. Dooku then slices Obi-Wan's leg for good measure. Obi-Wan stumbles back against the wall, trips, and crashes to the ground.

Dooku knocks Obi-Wan's green lightsaber from Anakin's hand and relentless drives Anakin back. Anakin retreats, slicing a power cable on the floor. The hangar is cast into darkness, except for the blue and scarlet lights of the lightsaber blades. Another fierce, lightning-fast clash of blades. With a roar, Anakin thrusts forward -- and Dooku cuts Anakin's sword arm off at the elbow. ",
        "Before he even has the chance to scream, Dooku throws out his hand and Anakin is Force-shoved across the room. He falls and skids to a halt beside Obi-Wan's body, driven unconscious by the shock and pain. Dooku sighs and extinguishes his lightsaber, suddenly seeming much older. He looks up and turns at a tapping noise at the hangar door'",

Dooku deflects it into the wall, but just barely. He shoots more lightning out. Yoda again catches it in his hand, and it absorbs into his palm. ",

        "Yoda attacks! He flies forward with a screeching yell. Dooku is forced to retreat. Words are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. The little gnome's lightsaber is a blur of emerald-green light, too fast for Dooku to defend against. He smoothly blocks Dooku's blows and spins through the air like a tiny tornado, bouncing off the Sail Ship and the hangar wall. Finally, their blades cross and the fighting slows. Yoda inches closer and quietly speaks'",

In the blink of an eye, Yoda closes his eyes and concentrates. The fallen crane trembles and starts to lift. Count Dooku runs up the ship's ramp, throwing a last look back before going inside. ",
        "Obi-Wan is still awake and tries to add what little strength he has left into helping his old master. Yoda concentrates harder. Slowly, with their combined power, the crane rises. Yoda exerts every ounce of his powers. The crane lifts clear of Obi-Wan and Anakin and is thrown to the ground.",

        "Padme and the Clone Troopers rush in. The very sight of Padme reinvigorates Anakin, and he pulls himself up as well. Padme runs up to Anakin and throws her arms around him. Anakin is so tired and exhausted that he can barely stand. The clone captain approaches Yoda. ",
