ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can't reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.",

Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger's seat.",

        "DEXTER JETTSTER: It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.",
        "OBI-WAN: Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? (laughing) Kamino... doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?",
        "DEXTER JETTSTER: No, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive. These Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too.",

        "JOCASTA NU: He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.",
        "OBI-WAN: It's very interesting. I'm not sure I completely understand.",

The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...",

After school, I became a Senatorial advisor with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. For the most part it was because of my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.",

        "PADME AMIDALA: Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.",
        "QUEEN JAMILLIA: The armies of commerce! Why has nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?",

        "SIO BIBBLE: It's outrageous that, after all of those hearings, and four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the Senate is powerless to resolve this crisis. Do those money mongers control everything?",

The Republic cannot be fixed, M'Lady. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, no? A shell game played on the voters. The time will come when that cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.",
        "PADME AMIDALA: I cannot believe that. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government! I will not forsake all I have honored and worked for and betray the Republic.",

        "DOOKU: I wouldn't think of such an offense. But, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M'Lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I'm afraid. It's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to cooperate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. Without your cooperation, I've done all I can for you.",

At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm and unleashes a blast of Force lightning. ANAKIN is hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN.",

        "OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then DOOKU's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.",

        "ANAKIN: I'm a slow learner.",
        "And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the COUNT slightly off balance. ANAKIN's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back.",

ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends ANAKIN's arm, cut off at the elbow, flying, still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.",

COUNT DOOKU then causes great boulders in the ceiling above YODA to fall, and again, YODA deflects the boulders which fall around him. YODA deflects Force lightning thrown at him by the enraged COUNT DOOKU.",

        "COUNT DOOKU: It is obvious this contest will not be decided by our knowledge of the Force, but by our skills with a lightsaber.",
        "COUNT DOOKU whirls his lightsaber in a formal salute. YODA draws his lightsaber. Suddenly, COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that COUNT DOOKU aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feeble, slower.",
        "YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Words are insufficient to describe the range and skill of YODA's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light. Finally, their blades cross and the fighting slows.",

        "COUNT DOOKU: The battle is far from over. This is just the beginning.",
        "Then, with all his might, COUNT DOOKU uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down toward OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. ANAKIN wakes. But in the blink of and eye, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN attempt to hold up the crane, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates, adding his strength to the two fallen JEDI and moves the crane aside. COUNT DOOKU runs up the ship's ramp, throwing a look back before going inside.",
        "The sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.",
