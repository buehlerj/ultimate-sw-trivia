Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly.","Obi-Wan: I have a bad feeling about this.","Qui-Gon: I don't sense anything.","Obi-Wan: It's not about the mission, Master.

That little droid did it. He bypassed the main power drive. Deflector shields up at maximum.","Ric: There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.","Qui-Gon: We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.","Obi-Wan: Here, Master. Tatooine. It's small, out of the way, poor. The Trade Federation have no presence there.","Panaka: How can you be sure?","Qui-Gon: It's controlled by the Hutts.","Panaka: You can't take Her Royal Highness there. The Hutts are gangsters. If they discovered her...","Qui-Gon: It'd be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation, except that the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us the advantage.","Palpatine: And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?","Nute: She has disappeared, my lord. One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.","Palpatine: I want that treaty signed.","Nute: My lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.","Palpatine: Not for a Sith. This is my apprentice, Darth Maul. He will find your lost ship.","Nute: This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them.","Rune: We should not have made this bargain.","Panaka: An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.","Sabe: It is to be commended. What is its number?","Panaka: R2-D2, Your Highness.","Sabe: Thank you, R2-D2.","Sabe: Padm\xe9. Clean this droid up as best you can. It deserves our gratitude.","Sabe: Continue, Captain.","Qui-Gon: Your Highness, with your permission, we're heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.

We'll need a new one.","Qui-Gon: That'll complicate things. Be wary. I sense a disturbance in the Force.","Obi-Wan: I feel it also, Master.","Qui-Gon: Don't let them send any transmissions.","Jar-Jar: This sun doen murder to mesa skin.","Panaka: Wait! Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you.","Qui-Gon: No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.","Panaka: The queen wishes it. She's curious about the planet.","Qui-Gon: This is not a good idea. Stay close to me.","Qui-Gon: Moisture farms, for the most part. Some indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few space ports like this one are havens for those that don't wish to be found.","Padme: Like us.","Jar-Jar: Dissen berry berry bad. Oh!

They live on the moons of Iego, I think.","Padme: You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?","Anakin: I listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here. I'm a pilot, you know, and someday I'm gonna fly away from this place.","Padme: You're a pilot?","Anakin: Mm-hmm. All my life.","Padme: How long have you been here?","Anakin: Since I was very little. Three, I think. My mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us betting on the Podraces.","Padme: You're a slave?","Anakin: I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.","Padme: I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. This is a strange place to me.","Jar-Jar: Hmm. Hmm. Where... Wheres yousa goin? I got ya.","Anakin: Hey!","Jar-Jar: What?","Anakin: Hit the nose.","Watto: A T-14 hyperdrive generator. Thee in luck. I'm the only one hereabouts who has one. But thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think, huh?","Watto: Saying of which, how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?","Qui-Gon: I have 20,000 Republic dataries.","Watto: Republic credits? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real.","Qui-Gon: I don't have anything else, but credits will do fine.","Watto: No, they won't.","Qui-Gon: Credits will do fine.","Watto: No, they won't! What, you think you're some kind of Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don't work on me. Only money.","Watto: No money, no parts, no deal.","Watto: And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.","Anakin: Wouldn't have lasted long anyways if I wasn't so good at building things.","Jar-Jar: Aw! Ooh!! Ai, ai! Whoa, ai!","Qui-Gon: We're leaving. JarJar.","Jar-Jar: Whaaa!","Padme: I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.","Anakin: I was glad to meet you too.","Jar-Jar: What? Wha... Oh.","Watto: Outlanders. They think we know nothing.","Anakin: They seemed nice to me.","Watto: Clean the racks. Then you can go home.","Anakin: Yippee!","Qui-Gon: And you're sure there's nothing left on board?","Obi-Wan: A few containers of supplies. The queen's wardrobe, maybe, but not enough for you to barter with, not in the amount you're talking about.","Qui-Gon: All right. I'm sure another solution will present itself. I'll check back later.","Jar-Jar: Noah gain! Noah gain. Da beings hereabouts, cawazy! Wesa be wobbed un crunched!","Qui-Gon: Not likely. We have nothing of value. That's our problem.","Jar-Jar: Hmm? Ah, mooie-mooie.","Gragra: Hey, hey! Are you going to pay for that?","Jar-Jar: Huh? Wanga?","Gragra: It costs seven wupiupi.","Sebulba: Ah! Chubaa...","Jar-Jar: Oops.","Sebulba: Is this yours?","Jar-Jar: Who, mesa? Ouch! Ouch!","Anakin: Careful, Sebulba. He's a big-time outlander. I'd hate to see you diced before we race again.","Sebulba: Next time we race, boy, it will be the end of you. If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now.","Anakin: Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me.","Anakin: Hi.","Qui-Gon: Hi there.","Anakin: Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug, an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.","Jar-Jar: Mesa haten crunchen. Das da las ting mesa want.","Qui-Gon: Nevertheless, the boy is right. You were heading into trouble. Thanks, my young friend.","Jar-Jar: But... But...But mesa doen notin!","Obi-Wan: This storm will slow them down.","Panaka: Looks pretty bad. Panaka.","Ric: Receiving a message from home.","Panaka: We'll be right there.","Anakin: Here, you'll like these pallies. Here.","Qui-Gon: Thank you.","Jira: Oh, my bones are aching. Storm's coming up, Ani. You better get home quick.","Anakin: Do you have shelter?","Qui-Gon: We'll head back to our ship.","Anakin: Is it far?","Padme: It's on the outskirts.","Anakin: You'll never reach the outskirts in time. Sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come on. I'll take you to my place.","Anakin: Mom! Mom, I'm home!","Jar-Jar: Ahh, dissen cosy.","Anakin: These are my friends, Mom.","Jar-Jar: Hello.","Qui-Gon: I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.","Anakin: I'm building a droid. You wanna see?","Qui-Gon: Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.","Anakin: Come on. I'll show you 3PO.","Jar-Jar: Oh, mooie-mooie.","Anakin: Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.","Padme: He's wonderful.","Anakin: You really like him? He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.","3PO: Oh. Oh. Uh...Where is everybody?","Anakin: Whoops. Yeah.","3PO: Oh, hello. I am C-3 PO, human-cyborg relations. How might I serve you?","Padme: He's perfect.","3PO: Oh. Perfect.","Anakin: When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer. I'm building a Podracer.","3PO: I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.","3PO: Oh, hello. I don't believe we have been introduced.","3PO: R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.","3PO: I beg your pardon, but what do you mean, 'naked'? My parts are showing? My goodness! Oh!","Sio: The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me.","Obi-Wan: It's a trick. Send no reply. Send no transmissions of any kind.","Qui-Gon: It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.","Obi-Wan: What if it is true, and the people are dying?","Qui-Gon: Either way, we're running out of time.","Maul: Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.","Palpatine: Move against the Jedi first. You will then have no difficulty in taking the queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.","Maul: At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.","Palpatine: You have been well-trained, my young apprentice. They will be no match for you.","Shmi: All slaves have a transmitter placed inside their bodies somewhere.","Anakin: I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.","Shmi: Any attempt to escape...","Anakin: And they blow you up! Boom!","Jar-Jar: How wude!","Padme: I can't believe there's still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's antislavery laws...","Shmi: The Republic doesn't exist out here. We must survive on our own.","Jar-Jar: Xcuse me.","Anakin: Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?","Qui-Gon: They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.","Anakin: I'm the only human who can do it.","Qui-Gon: You must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods.","Qui-Gon: Don't do that again.","Anakin: You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?","Qui-Gon: What makes you think that?","Anakin: I saw your laser sword. Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.","Qui-Gon: Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.","Anakin: I don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.","Qui-Gon: I wish that were so.","Anakin: I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves. Have you come to free us?","Qui-Gon: No, I'm afraid not.","Anakin: I think you have. Why else would you be here?","Qui-Gon: I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin. We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission.","Anakin: How did you end up out here in the outer rim?","Padme: Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.","Anakin: I can help. I can fix anything.","Qui-Gon: I believe you can. But first we must acquire the parts we need.","Jar-Jar: Wit no-nutten mula to trade.","Padme: These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.","Shmi: Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.","Qui-Gon: Podracing. Greed can be a powerful ally.","Anakin: I built a racer. It's the fastest ever. There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod.","Shmi: Anakin! Watto won't let you.","Anakin: Watto doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it was yours and get him to let me pilot it for you.","Shmi: I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.","Anakin: But, Mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.","Shmi: Anakin.","Qui-Gon: Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who can help us?","Shmi: No.","Anakin: Mom, you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other.","Padme: I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way.","Shmi: No. There is no other way. I may not like it, but he can help you. He was meant to help you.","Padme: Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know? The queen will not approve.","Qui-Gon: The queen doesn't need to know.","Padme: Well, I don't approve.","Watto: The boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race. How can you do this? Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?","Qui-Gon: My ship will be the entry fee.","Watto: Oh, not bad! Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?","Qui-Gon: It's in good order, except for the parts I need.","Watto: What would the boy ride? He smashed up my pod in the last race. It will take some long time to fix it.","Anakin: It wasn't my fault, really. Sebulba flashed me with his vents. I actually saved the pod, mostly.","Watto: Mmm. That you did, huh. The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?","Qui-Gon: I have acquired a pod in a game of chance, the fastest ever built.","Watto: I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh?","Watto: So, you supply the pod and the entry fee, and I supply the boy. We split the winnings, um, 50-50, I think, huh?","Qui-Gon: If it's going to be 50-50, I suggest you front the cash for the entry.","Qui-Gon: If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need. And if we lose, you keep my ship. Either way, you win.","Watto: Deal! Your friend is a foolish one, me thinks.","Obi-Wan: What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here a very long time.","Qui-Gon: Well, it's too dangerous to call for help, and a ship without a power supply isn't going to get us anywhere.","Qui-Gon: And...there's something about this boy.","Qui-Gon: You should be very proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward.","Shmi: Well, he knows nothing of greed. He has a...","Qui-Gon: He has special powers.","Shmi: Yes.","Qui-Gon: He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It's a Jedi trait.","Shmi: He deserves better than a slave's life.","3PO: Why, certainly.","Qui-Gon: Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early.","Qui-Gon: The Force is unusually strong with him. That much is clear. Who was his father?","Shmi: There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him. I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?","Qui-Gon: I don't know. I didn't actually come here to free slaves.","Kids: Hey. Hi, Ani. Hi.","Kitster: Wow, a real astro droid. How did you get so lucky?","Anakin: That isn't the half of it. I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.","Kitster: What? With this?","W. Wald: You're such a joker, Ani.","Kids: You've been working on that thing for years. It's never gonna run. Come on. Let's go and play ball. Keep racing, Ani. You're gonna be bug squash.","Anakin: Hey, JarJar. Keep away from those energy binders. If your hand gets caught in the beam, it's gonna go numb for hours.","Jar-Jar: Sorry. Okay. My tongue is fat. My tongue... Wrench. Where is da wrench? Oh, dare it is. Hey. Uh-oh. Uh, Ani, I'm stuck. Ani...","3PO: You know, I find that JarJar creature to be a little odd.","Kister: You don't even know if this thing's gonna run.","Anakin: It will.","Qui-Gon: I think it's time we found out. Here, use this power charge.","Anakin: Yes, sir!","Qui-Gon: Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.","Jar-Jar: My... My mouth. Ani, I'm stuck. Uh, hey. My tongue is fat. Ani!","3PO: You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.","Jar-Jar: Oh. Th... Thank you. Go.","Anakin: It's working! It's working!","Qui-Gon: Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.","Anakin: There's so many. Do they all have a system of planets?","Qui-Gon: Most of them.","Anakin: Has anyone been to 'em all?","Qui-Gon: Not likely.","Anakin: I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.","Shmi: Ani, bedtime!","Anakin: Ow!","Qui-Gon: There we are. Good as new.","Shmi: Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.","Anakin: What are you doing?","Qui-Gon: Checking your blood for infections. Go on. You have a big day tomorrow. Sleep well, Ani.","Qui-Gon: Obi-Wan?","Obi-Wan: Yes, Master?","Qui-Gon: I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.","Obi-Wan: Wait a minute.","Qui-Gon: I need a midi-chlorian count.","Obi-Wan: The reading is off the chart. Over 20,000. Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high.","Qui-Gon: No Jedi has.","Obi-Wan: What does that mean?","Qui-Gon: I'm not sure.","Watto: I wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over.","Qui-Gon: Patience, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set. And we'll be far away from here.","Watto: Not if your ship belongs to me, I think, huh? I warn you, no funny business.","Qui-Gon: You don't think Anakin can win?","Watto: Don't get me wrong, no. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race, but, uh, Sebulba there is going to win, I think.","Jar-Jar: Oh, no!","Qui-Gon: Why do you think that?","Watto: He always wins! I am betting heavily on Sebulba.","Qui-Gon: I'll take that bet.","Watto: You what?","Qui-Gon: I'll wager my new racing pod against, say, the boy and his mother.","Watto: No pod is worth two slaves, not by a long shot.","Qui-Gon: The boy, then.","Watto: Hmm. Well, uh... We'll let fate decide, huh? I just happen to have a chance cube here. Blue, it's the boy. Red, uh... his mother.","Watto: You won this small toss, outlander, but you won't win the race! So it makes little difference!","Watto: Better stop your friend's betting, or I'll end up owning him too.","Anakin: What'd he mean by that?","Qui-Gon: I'll tell you later. Good morning.","3PO: Oh, my. Space travel sounds rather perilous.","3PO: I can assure you, they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships.","Kitster: This is so wizard, Ani. I'm sure you'll do it this time.","Padme: Do what?","Kitster: Finish the race, of course.","Padme: You've never won a race?","Anakin: Well, not exactly.","Padme: Not even finished?","Anakin: Kitster's right. I will this time.","Qui-Gon: Of course you will.","Beed: Toogi! Toogie! Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos azalus ooval Poddraces.","Fode: That's absolutely right. And a big turnout here from all corners of the outer rim territories.","Fode: I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid.","Beed: La Yma beestoo.","Fode: I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.","Beed: ... eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia!","Fode: Two-time winner Boles Roor.","Beed: Poo tula moosta, woe grane champio Sebulba du Pixelito! Splastyleeya bookie ookie!!","Fode: And in the front row, nearside pole position, Mawhonic!","Fode: A hearty hello to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!","Clegg Holdfast: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.","Fode: And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt with that incredible racing machine, the Vulptereen 327.","Fode: And hoping for a big win today, Ody Mandrell, with his record-setting pit droid team.","Fode: And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker, A local boy.","Fode: I see the flags are moving out onto the track.","Jar-Jar: Huh? Pee yousa!","Shmi: Be safe.","Anakin: I will, Mom. I promise.","Sebulba: Uh-oh. You won't walk away from this one, you slave scum.","Anakin: Don't count on it, slime ball.","Sebulba: You're bantha fodder!","Qui-Gon: You all set, Ani?","Anakin: Yep.","Qui-Gon: Right.","Anakin: Whoa!","Qui-Gon: Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.","Anakin: I will.","Qui-Gon: May the Force be with you.","Beed: O grandio lust amu intoe tah parena, Jabba Du Hutt.","Jabba: Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee madda hodrudda du wundee. (Welcome! Begin the race!)'","Fode: Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.","Shmi: Is he nervous?","Qui-Gon: He's fine.","Padme: You Jedi are far too reckless. The queen is not...","Qui-Gon: The queen trusts my judgement, young handmaiden. You should too.","Padme: You assume too much.","Fode: Start your engines.","Jar-Jar: Oh, dissen gonna be messy. Me no watch'n!","Beed: An dare ovv!","Anakin: Oh, no! No!","Fode: Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.","Fode: Well, it looks like Quadinaros is having engine trouble also.","Jar-Jar: Come on, Ani!","Fode: And there goes Skywalker!","Jar-Jar: Go, Ani, go!","Fode: He will be hard-pressed to catch up with the leaders.","Sebulba: Haaaa!","Crowd: Sebulba!","Fode: Looks like a few Tusken Raiders are camped out on the canyon dune turn.","Quadinaros: Doowat macroon!","Fode: Ooh, there goes Quadinaros' power coupling.","Quadinaros: Cheespa wata! Ooh!","Beed: Chubba ni chees Sebulba!","Watto: Paketa!","Sebulba: Kulkah meeka!","Beed: Ody Mandrell coona wa wunda dungo!","Pit Droid: Whoa!","Ody: Oh, no!","3PO: Where is Master Anakin?","Padme: Look. Here he comes.","Fode: It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field.","Kitster: Yay! Yippee!","3PO: He has to complete two more circuits? Oh, dear.","Mars Guo: Arrr!","Fode: Skywalker's spinning out of control!","Crowd: Shebulba!","Fode: Oh, I don't care what universe you're from. That's gotta hurt!","Jar-Jar: Here he comes!","Fode: At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba's in the lead, followed closely by Skywalker!","Kitster: Go, Ani!","Fode: Skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp!","Sebulba: Whoa-oa! Huh?","Fode: It's Skywalker!","Crowd: Sebulba!","Fode: Amazing! A quick control thrust, and he's back on course!","Jar-Jar: Did he crash-ed?","Sebulba: Wah hota!","Fode: Skywalker's in trouble! Sebulba takes the lead!","Fode: He's catching Sebulba!","Beed: Inkabunga!","Jar-Jar: Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!","Sebulba: Wha... Chuba da noya!","Fode: That little human being is out of his mind.","Beed: Punda tah punda!","Fode: They're side by side!","Beed: Bangu du bangu!","Sebulba: Wa-waaaaah! Poo doo!","Kitster: Yippee! Yay!","Wald: Ya eeka buta! Whoo-hoo-hoo!","3PO: I can't believe it.","Fode: The crowds are going nuts!","Fode: Ooh! Ooh!!","Beed: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!!","Jar-Jar: Yay, Ani!","Anakin: Mom, I did it! Yeah!","Jar-Jar: Good going, Ani!","Padme: We owe you everything, Ani.","Shmi: Mmm!","Anakin: Aww.","Shmi: It's so wonderful, Ani. You have brought hope to those who have none. I'm so very proud of you.","Anakin: Aww.","Watto: Oy chuba no. You. You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to do it. Somehow you knew it. I lost everything.","Qui-Gon: Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose. Bring the parts to the main hangar. I'll come by your shop later on so you can release the boy.","Watto: You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.","Qui-Gon: Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts? I'm sure they can settle this.","Watto: Take him.","Jar-Jar: Hidoe!","Qui-Gon: Well, we have all the essential parts we need. I'm going back. Some unfinished business. I won't be long.","Obi-Wan: Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life-form?","Qui-Gon: It's the boy who's responsible for getting us these parts. Get this hyperdrive generator installed.","Obi-Wan: Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long. Come on. Hup!","Qui-Gon: Hey. These are yours.","Anakin: Yes! Mom, we sold the pod! Look at all the money we have!","Shmi: My goodness! But that's so wonderful, Ani.","Qui-Gon: And he has been freed.","Anakin: What?","Qui-Gon: You're no longer a slave.","Anakin: Did you hear that?","Shmi: Now you can make your dreams come true, Ani. You are free. Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?","Qui-Gon: Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.","Anakin: You mean I get to come with you in your starship?","Qui-Gon: Anakin, training to become a Jedi is not an easy challenge, and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.","Anakin: But I wanna go. It's what I've always dreamed of doing. Can I go, Mom?","Shmi: Anakin, this path has been placed before you. The choice is yours alone.","Anakin: I wanna do it.","Qui-Gon: Then pack your things. We haven't much time.","Anakin: Yippee!","Anakin: What about Mom? Is she free too?","Qui-Gon: I tried to free your mother, Ani, but Watto wouldn't have it.","Anakin: You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?","Shmi: Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go.","Anakin: I don't want things to change.","Shmi: But you can't stop the change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Oh, I love you. Now, hurry.","Shmi: Thank you.","Qui: I'll watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?","Shmi: Yeah.","3PO: Oh! Oh, my. Oh! Hello, Master Anakin.","Anakin: Well, 3PO, I've been freed and I'm going away in a starship.","3PO: Master Anakin, you are my maker and I wish you well. However, I should prefer it if I were a little more completed.","Anakin: I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, giving you coverings and all. I'm gonna miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything.","3PO: Sell me?","Anakin: Bye.","3PO: Oh, my.","Anakin: I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.","Shmi: Ani.","Anakin: Will I ever see you again?","Shmi: What does your heart tell you?","Anakin: I hope so. Yes. I guess.","Shmi: Then we will see each other again.","Anakin: I will come back and free you, Mom. I promise.","Shmi: Now, be brave, and don't look back. Don't look back.","Anakin: Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!","Qui-Gon: Anakin! Drop! Go! Tell them to take off!","Panaka: Qui-Gon's in trouble.","Obi-Wan: Take off. Over there. Fly low.","Anakin: Are you all right?","Qui-Gon: I think so.","Obi-Wan: What was it?","Qui-Gon: I'm not sure, but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is it was after the queen.","Anakin: What are we gonna do about it?","Qui-Gon: We shall be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Anakin: Hi. You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.","Nute: Your queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.","Sio: This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided.","Nute: Take him away.","B1 Battle Droid Captain: My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumoured underwater villages. They will not stay hidden for long.","Sio: The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me.","Padme: You all right?","Anakin: It's very cold.","Padme: You come from a warm planet, Ani. A little too warm for my taste. Space is cold.","Anakin: You seem sad.","Padme: The queen is worried. Her people are suffering, dying. She must convince the senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what'll happen.","Anakin: I made this for you, so you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet. It'll bring you good fortune.","Padme: It's beautiful. But I don't need this to remember you by. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani, but my caring for you will remain.","Anakin: I care for you, too, only I...","Padme: Miss your mother.","Ric: Coruscant. The entire planet is one big city. There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle. And look over there. Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.","Palpatine: It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. With the communications breakdown, we've been very concerned.","Palpatine: I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation.","Palpatine: May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.","Valorum: Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honour to finally meet you in person.","Sabe: Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.","Valorum: I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the current situation. I've called for a special session of the senate to hear your position.","Sabe: I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.","Palpatine: There is a question of procedure, but I'm confident we can overcome it.","Qui-Gon: I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately. The situation has become much more complicated.","Padme: Ani, come on.","Jar-Jar: The queen's a bein' grossly nice, mesa tinks. Pitty hot.","Palpatine: There is no civility, only politics. The Republic is not what it once was. The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.","Palpatine: There is no interest in the common good. I must be frank, Your Majesty. There is little chance the senate will act on the invasion.","Padme: Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.","Palpatine: If I may say so, Your Majesty, the chancellor has little real power. He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. The bureaucrats are in charge now.","Padme: What options have we?","Palpatine: Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor, one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice.","Palpatine: You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.","Padme: He has been our strongest supporter.","Palpatine: Our only other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.","Padme: The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate. Our people are dying, Senator. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.","Palpatine: To be realistic, Your Majesty, I think we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.","Padme: That is something I cannot do.","Qui-Gon: He was trained in the Jedi arts. My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Impossible. The Sith have been extinct for a millennium.","Mace: I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing.","Yoda: Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.","Mace: We will use all our resources to unravel this mystery. We will discover the identity of your attacker. May the Force be with you.","Yoda: Master Qui-Gon. More to say have you?","Qui-Gon: With your permission, my master, I have encountered a vergence in the Force.","Yoda: A vergence, you say?","Mace: Located around a person?","Qui-Gon: A boy. His cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.","Mace: You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the Force. You believe it's this boy?","Qui-Gon: I don't presume to...","Yoda: But you do. Revealed your opinion is.","Qui-Gon: I request the boy be tested, Master.","Yoda: Oh? Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?","Qui-Gon: Finding him was the will of the Force. I have no doubt of that.","Mace: Bring him before us, then.","Nubian Guard: The boy's here to see Padm\xe9.","Corde: Let him in. I'm sorry, Ani, but Padm\xe9's not here right now.","Padme: Who is it?","Corde: Anakin Skywalker to see Padm\xe9, Your Highness.","Padme: I've sent Padm\xe9 on an errand.","Anakin: I'm on my way to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope. I may never see her again, so I came to say good-bye.","Padme: We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.","Anakin: Thank you, Your Highness.","Valorum: The chair recognizes the senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.","Palpatine: Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the senate, a tragedy has occurred which started right here with the taxation of trade routes and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation.","Lott Dod: This is outrageous! I object to the senator's statements.","Valorum: The chair does not recognize the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.","Palpatine: To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, recently elected ruler of the Naboo, who speaks on our behalf.","Padme: Honourable representatives of the Republic, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade...","Lott Dod: I object! There is no proof! This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.","Aks Moe: The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honourable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed.","Valorum: The point...","Mas Amedda: Excuse me, Chancellor.","Palpatine: Enter the bureaucrat. The true rulers of the Republic. And on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.","Valorum: The point is conceded. Will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?","Padme: I will not defer. I've come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now.","Padme: I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed.","Padme: I move for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.","Congress: Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!","Mas Amedda: Order!","Palpatine: Now they will elect a new chancellor, a strong chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue.","Obi-Wan: The boy will not pass the council's test, Master. He's too old.","Qui-Gon: Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.","Obi-Wan: Do not defy the council, Master, not again.","Qui-Gon: I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.","Obi-Wan: If you would just follow the code, you would be on the council. They will not go along with you this time.","Qui-Gon: You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.","Anakin: A ship. A cup. A ship. A speeder.","Yoda: Hmm. How feel you?","Anakin: Cold, sir.","Yoda: Afraid are you?","Anakin: No, sir.","Yoda: See through you we can.","Mace: Be mindful of your feelings.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Your thoughts dwell on your mother.","Anakin: I miss her.","Yoda: Mmm. Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?","Anakin: What has that got to do with anything?","Yoda: Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.","Jar-Jar: Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?","Padme: I don't know.","Jar-Jar: Gungans get pasted too, eh?","Padme: I hope not.","Jar-Jar: Gungans no dyin' without a fight. Wesa warriors. Wesa got a grand army. Dat's why you no liken us, mesa tinks.","Panaka: Your Highness? Your Highness. Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as supreme chancellor.","Palpatine: A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.","Palpatine: Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption.","Padme: Who else has been nominated?","Panaka: Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.","Palpatine: I feel confident our situation will create a strong sympathy vote for us. I will be chancellor.","Padme: I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, senator, there'll be nothing left of our people, our way of life.","Palpatine: I understand your concern, Your Majesty. Unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet.","Padme: Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I've decided to go back to Naboo.","Palpatine: Go back? But, Your Majesty, be realistic. They'll force you to sign the treaty.","Padme: I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different than that of our people. Captain.","Panaka: Your Highness.","Padme: Ready my ship.","Palpatine: Please, Your Majesty, stay here where it's safe.","Padme: It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: The Force is strong with him.","Qui-Gon: He is to be trained, then?","Mace: No, he will not be trained.","Qui-Gon: No?","Mace: He is too old.","Qui-Gon: He is the chosen one. You must see it.","Yoda: Mmm. Clouded this boy's future is.","Qui-Gon: I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.","Yoda: An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible to take on a second.","Mace: The code forbids it.","Qui-Gon: Obi-Wan is ready.","Obi-Wan: I am ready to face the trials.","Yoda: Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready.","Qui-Gon: He is headstrong, and he has much to learn of the living Force, but he is capable. There is little more he can learn from me.","Yoda: Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later. Now is not the time for this.","Mace: The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor, and Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation and could widen the confrontation.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: And draw out the queen's attacker.","Mace: Go with the queen to Naboo and discover the identity of this dark warrior. This is the clue we need to unravel the mystery of the Sith.","Yoda: May the Force be with you.","Obi-Wan: It's not disrespect, Master. It's the truth.","Qui-Gon: From your point of view.","Obi-Wan: The boy is dangerous. They all sense it. Why can't you?","Qui-Gon: His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.","Qui-Gon: The council will decide Anakin's future. That should be enough for you. Now get on board.","Anakin: Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.","Qui-Gon: You won't be, Ani. I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful.","Qui-Gon: Always remember: Your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you'll be safe.","Anakin: Master, sir, I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians. I've been wondering... What are midi-chlorians?","Qui-Gon: Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form that resides within all living cells.","Anakin: They live inside me?","Qui-Gon: Inside your cells, yes. And we are symbionts with them.","Anakin: Symbionts?","Qui-Gon: Life-forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist and we would have no knowledge of the Force.","Qui-Gon: They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind, you'll hear them speaking to you.","Anakin: I don't understand.","Qui-Gon: With time and training, Ani, you will. You will.","Qui-Gon: Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.","Padme: I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears that the Federation means to destroy me.","Qui-Gon: I assure you I will not allow that to happen.","Jar-Jar: Wesa goin' home!","Anakin: Come on, R2.","Palpatine: Is the planet secure?","Nute: We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life-forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.","Palpatine: Good. I will see to it that in the senate things stay as they are.","Palpatine: I am sending my apprentice, Darth Maul, to join you.","Nute: Yes, my lord.","Rune: A Sith here?","Ric: Those are the forward stabilizers.","Anakin: And those two control the pitch?","Ric: You catch on pretty quick.","Panaka: As soon as we land, the Federation will arrest you and force you to sign the treaty.","Qui-Gon: I agree. I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this.","Padme: I will take back what's ours.","Panaka: There are too few of us, Your Highness. We have no army.","Qui-Gon: And I can only protect you. I can't fight a war for you.","Padme: JarJar Binks.","Jar-Jar: Mesa, Your Highness?","Padme: Yes. I need your help.","Ric: I have one battleship on my scope.","Obi-Wan: It's a droid control ship.","Panaka: They've probably spotted us.","Obi-Wan: We haven't much time.","Obi-Wan: JarJar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.","Qui-Gon: Good.","Obi-Wan: Do you think the queen's idea will work?","Qui-Gon: The Gungans will not be easily swayed. And we cannot use our power to help her.","Obi-Wan: I'm... I'm sorry for my behaviour, Master. It's not my place to disagree with you about the boy. And I am grateful you think I'm ready to take the trials.","memery2Hype You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan. And you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi knight.","Jar-Jar: Desa nobody dare. The Gungan city is deserted. Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.","Obi-Wan: Do you think they have been taken to the camps?","Panaka: More likely they were wiped out.","Jar-Jar: Mesa no tink so.","Qui-Gon: Do you know where they are, JarJar?","Jar-Jar: When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place. Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!","Tarpals: Your Honour, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.","Jar-Jar: Uh, h-hello dadee, Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.","Boss: JarJar Binks.

I'm sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to protect myself.","Padme: Although we do not always agree, Your Honour, our two great societies have always lived in peace.","Boss: Ah.","Padme: The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever.","Padme: I ask you to help us. No, I beg you to help us. We are your humble servants. Our fate is in your hands.","Boss: Ha! Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans? Meeesa lika dis! Maybe... wesa... being friends.","Jar-Jar: Yippee! Ya-hoo!","Nute: We've sent our patrols.

A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground resistance movement. I brought back as many of the leaders as I could.","Panaka: The Federation army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger.","Panaka: Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think that we can win.","Padme: The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the droid army away from the cities. R2.","Padme: We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka will create a diversion.","Padme: Then we can enter the palace and capture the viceroy. Without the viceroy, they will be lost and confused. What do you think, Master Jedi?","Qui-Gon: The viceroy will be well-guarded.","Panaka: The difficulty is getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.","Qui-Gon: There is a possibility, with this diversion, many Gungans will be killed.","Boss: Wesa ready to do our-san part.","Padme: We have a plan which should immobilize the droid army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the droid control ship orbiting the planet.","Qui-Gon: A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields. There's an even bigger danger.","Obi-Wan: If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.","Padme: Well, that is why we must not fail to get the viceroy. Everything depends on it.","Palpatine: She is more foolish than I thought.","Nute: We are sending all troops to meet this army assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives.","Palpatine: This will work to our advantage.","Nute: I have your approval to proceed, then, my lord?","Palpatine: Wipe them out. All of them.","Tarpals: Halt! Starting up the shield.","B1 Battle Droid Captain: Open fire.","Qui-Gon: Once we get inside, you find a safe place to hide and stay there.","Anakin: Sure.","Qui-Gon: Stay there.","B1 Battle Droid: Roger. Roger.","Nute: I thought the battle was going to take place far from here. This is too close.","Qui-Gon: Ani, find cover. Quick!","Padme: Get to your ships!","Ric: Fighters straight ahead.","Bravo Three: Roger, Bravo Leader.","Bravo Five: Roger, Bravo Leader.","B1 Battle Droid Captain: Cease fire.","Jar-Jar: Steady.

You'll be safe there.","Anakin: But I...","Qui-Gon: Stay in that cockpit.","Qui-Gon: We'll handle this.","Padme: We'll take the long way.","Anakin: We gotta do something, R2. I'm trying to! I don't know where the trigger is!","Anakin: Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one. Nope. Wait. Here it is.","Anakin: Yeah! Let's go! It's on automatic pilot.

Get off! Ooh! Ooh! Mooie!","Ric: The deflector shield is too strong.","Anakin: This is tense! Whoa! R2, get us off this autopilot. It's gonna get us both killed.","Anakin: You did it, R2! Okay, let's go left. Go back? Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, so that's what I'm gonna do.","Anakin: I'll try spinning. That's a good trick. Whoa!","Anakin: I know we're in trouble.

My give up.","Nute: Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty and end this pointless debate in the senate.","Sabe: Viceroy! Your occupation here has ended.","Nute: After her. This one's a decoy.","Padme: Captain!","Panaka: Jam the doors.","Padme: Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty.","Anakin: Yes! We have power.

Whoo!","Bravo Three: Yeah!","Bravo Two: Hee-hee!","Jar-Jar: What the...Was'n they doing?","Tarpals: The control ship has been destroyed.

Promise me you will train the boy.","Obi-Wan: Yes, Master.","Qui-Gon: He is the chosen one. He... will bring balance.

We will watch your career with great interest.","Padme: Congratulations on your election, Chancellor.","Palpatine: Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It's you who should be congratulated.","Palpatine: Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic.","Yoda: Confer on you the level of Jedi knight the council does. But agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner I do not.","Obi-Wan: Qui-Gon believed in him.","Yoda: The chosen one the boy may be. Nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.","Obi-Wan: Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the council, if I must.","Yoda: Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that you do not.","Yoda: Agree with you the council does. Your apprentice Skywalker will be.","Anakin: What will happen to me now?","Obi-Wan: The council have granted me permission to train you.

He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, Senator Amidala's Security Officer. He moves over to the FEMALE PILOT. ","TYPHO: We made it. ","The ramp lowers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear first.

Obi-Wan is now thirty-five, with long hair and a graying beard. He strongly resembles the late Qui-Gon Jinn now, in more ways than one. Anakin, meanwhile, is virtually unrecognizable. The nineteen-year-old towers over Obi-Wan, and is lanky and handsome. While he wears his hair in the manner of a Padawan Learner (short and spiky with a long braid), his uniform is darker and more stylish than the usual apprentice.

Obi-Wan realizes the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The droid's systems light up again, and it takes off. The droid bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose.

Zam then flies her speeder sharply downward. Anakin steers his speeder down after her. The two speeders plunge straight down through moving lanes of air traffic.

They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. Zam weaves around flaming smokestacks at very close range, trying to set her pursuers on fire. ","The chase heads for a power refinery. Pulling out her laser pistol, Zam shoots a power coupler causing voltage, like lightning, to jump across a gap from one coupler to another. But Anakin stays on course, piloting the speeder directly through the arc. Anakin and Obi-Wan's bodies ripple with blue power. Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass. ","OBI-WAN: Anakin, how many times have I told you to stay away from power couplings?!? ","The speeders finally fly out of the lightning. ","OBI-WAN: (sarcastic) Oh, that was good'","ANAKIN: That was crazy!!!","The Jedi tear after Zam. Zam goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. Zam turns down and left, into a transit tunnel built into a huge building. Anakin pulls up and to the right. ","OBI-WAN: Where are you going?!? He went that way!!

","OBI-WAN: I hate it when he does that. ","Anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunter's speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. Zam looks up and realizes what has happened. Suddenly, Zam just stops, and Anakin flies forward to the left front fork. Zam shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a blast near Anakin's hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. Anakin slides to the right fork of the speeder, where Zam can't reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop. Zam takes off, and Anakin slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but he manages to hang on. He works his way back to the speeder's cockpit. Zam briefly changes back into her gray reptilian Clawdite form and sneers at him.","Obi-Wan has jumped into the driver's seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Soon Anakin is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. Zam takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless Jedi, knocking the sword out of Anakin's hand. Obi-Wan races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger's seat. ","Anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and grabs the gun in Zam's hand. They struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing the dashboard and speeder controls to bits.

Anakin moves to give chase into the very crowded street. ","It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected in filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various alien lowlifes, panhandling droids, and the occasional group of upper-class slummers. Anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing Zam. He loses the bounty hunter in the crowd, then sees her again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd. Obi-Wan lands the speeder in the nearby street. He gets out and runs through the crowd toward Anakin.","Ahead, Zam turns in through a door and disappears. A nightclub sign is flashing over the door.

Obi-Wan stops in front of it, studying the striking features of the chiseled face. On the walls, lighted computer panels seemed to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, five Jedi are seated at tables, studying archival material.","Obi-Wan studies the bust for a few moments before Madame JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist, comes up and stands next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi dressed in a yellow and brown robe. She's tough as old boots and smart as a whip. ","JOCASTA NU: Did you call for assistance? ","OBI-WAN: (slightly distracted) Yes'yes, I did. ","Jocasta Nu notices the bust Obi-Wan's studying. ","JOCASTA NU: He has a powerful face, doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing. ","OBI-WAN: I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.","JOCASTA NU: (sigh) 'The Lost Twenty'' Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the order.","OBI-WAN: What happened? ","JOCASTA NU: Well'Count Dooku was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council. Much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. ","OBI-WAN: (surprised) Really? ","JOCASTA NU: Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers, idealists' ","Jocasta Nu gazes at the bust as she speaks. ","JOCASTA NU: He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was'unique. (beat) In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.","OBI-WAN: It's very interesting. I'm not sure I completely understand.","JOCASTA NU: Well, I'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?","Obi-Wan leads Jocasta over to the computer terminal he was working on.","OBI-WAN: Yes. Um, I'm trying to find a planetary system called Kamino. It doesn't show up in any of the archive charts. ","JOCASTA NU: Kamino? It's not a system I'm familiar with. Let me see'","Jocasta Nu leans over Obi-Wan's shoulder, studying the screen closely. ","JOCASTA NU: Are you sure you have the right coordinates? ","OBI-WAN: (nods) According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here. Just south of the Rishi Maze. ","Jocasta Nu types some commands on the keyboard, and frowns at what she sees. ","JOCASTA NU: No coordinates? It sounds like the sort of directions you'd get from a street tout. Some old miner, or Furbog trader'","OBI-WAN: (smiles) All three, actually. ","JOCASTA NU: Are you sure it exists?","OBI-WAN: Absolutely. ","Jocasta grows more worried at what she sees on the monitor. ","JOCASTA NU: Let me do a gravitational scan' ","On the monitor, a star map hologram comes up. Several items blink up for attention. ","JOCASTA NU: Hmm. There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you're seeking was destroyed. ","OBI-WAN: Wouldn't that be on record? ","JOCASTA NU: It ought to be, unless it was very recent. (types some more, then shakes her head) I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist. ","OBI-WAN: Impossible'perhaps the archives are incomplete. ","JOCASTA NU: (archly) The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!","With an arrogant sniff, Jocasta Nu turns and notices a young boy approach.

NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD -- AFTERNOON","The speeder bus pulls up and stops at the Grand Courtyard of Theed, and Anakin, Padme and Artoo get out. Anakin stares out at the wide, beautiful courtyard in wonder. The great courtyard stretches before them, and they see the rose-colored domes of the palace on the far side. Artoo whistles. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. Artoo trundles behind them. ","ANAKIN: If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave. ","PADME: (laughs) I doubt that. ","ANAKIN: No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about' (beat) The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace. The way it shimmers in the sunlight. The way the air always smells of flowers'","PADME: (wistful) 'and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the capitol, I was very young. I'd never seen a waterfall before. I thought they were so beautiful'I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace. ","ANAKIN: Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?","PADME: (laughing) No! That was the last thing I thought of. But the more history I studied, the more I realized how much good politicians could do. After school I became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that before I knew it I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. (beat) I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.","ANAKIN: The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they even tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.","Padme frowns at this. ","PADME: Popular rule is not democracy, Ani. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up.","She looks down at the ground in contemplation. ","PADME: So were my parents. They worried about me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now' (grins at Anakin) My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids' but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.","ANAKIN: I agree with her! I think the Republic needs you' I'm glad that you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.","PADME: I think so too.","Anakin and Padme walk toward the palace. Artoo continues to follow. ","INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM -- AFTERNOON","QUEEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors. Outside the throne room, Artoo waits. ","QUEEN JAMILLIA: We've been worried about you. (takes Padme's hand) I'm so glad you're safe, Padme. ","PADME: Thank you, your Highness. I only wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote. ","SIO BIBBLE: Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has explained it all. Given the circumstances, Senator, returning home was the only real choice you could have made. ","Padme gives Bibble a resigned nod. ","QUEEN JAMILLIA: How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?","PADME: Thousands. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war. ","Both Jamillia and Sio are shaken by this. ","SIO BIBBLE: It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!","QUEEN JAMILLIA: Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?","PADME: Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Trade Federation or the Commerce Guilds for help.","QUEEN JAMILLIA: The armies of commerce! Why has nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?!? ","PADME: I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds. ","SIO BIBBLE: It's outrageous that after all of those hearings and four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the Senate is powerless to resolve this crisis. Do those money mongers control everything?","QUEEN JAMILLIA: Remember, Counselor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. (beat) That's a move in the right direction.","PADME: (winces) There are rumors, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.","ANAKIN: The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It was' considered to be too dangerous for the economy.","QUEEN JAMILLIA: (smiles) We must keep our faith in the Republic. ","The Queen rises from her throne, and everyone else rises with her. She crosses over to Padme. ","QUEEN JAMILLIA: The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.","PADME: Let's pray that day never comes.","QUEEN JAMILLIA: In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.","Anakin, Padme, the Queen, and Bibble walk towards the open throne room doors. The handmaidens trail along behind them.","SIO BIBBLE: What is your suggestion, Master Jedi? ","PADME: Oh, Anakin's not a Jedi yet. He's still a Padawan Learner. (To Jamillia) But I was thinking ' ","ANAKIN: Hey, hold on a minute'","PADME: (stern look at Anakin) Excuse me! (back to Jamillia) I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. ","ANAKIN: Excuse me! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady!!","The tension between the two fills the room. Bibble and Jamillia look at each other with worry. ","PADME: Ani, my life is at risk. And this is my home. I know it very well, that is why we're here. I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance. ","Anakin takes a deep breath and forces a polite smile, though his eyes still blaze with anger. ","ANAKIN: Sorry, M'Lady. ","SIO BIBBLE: (half amused) She's right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people, and a clear view of the surrounding terrain. ","QUEEN JAMILLIA: Perfect. It's settled then. Padme, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave ' your family's very worried about you'","PADME: Thank you, your Highness. ","Padme looks worried as she and Jamillia walk out of the throne room and down a staircase. Anakin and Bibble follow them. ","EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET ' AFTERNOON","PEOPLE are passing through a small street of Theed. OLD MEN are sunning themselves, WOMEN are gossiping, KIDS are playing. Anakin, Padme and Artoo turn onto a side street. Anakin is back in his Jedi robes and holding Padme's luggage. Padme is wearing a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.","PADME: There's my house!","Padme starts forward; Anakin hangs back.","PADME: What? Don't say you're shy!","ANAKIN: (untruthfully) No, but I --","Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward Padme.","RYOO & POOJA: Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!","PADME: Ryoo!! Pooja!!","Padme scoops up Ryoo and Pooja and hugs them.","PADME: I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.","Anakin and the girls say hello to each, both shyly. Then","PADME: Go wake up Artoo. ","RYOO & POOJA: ARTOO!!","As they see the droid, they run up and hug him. Artoo whistles and beeps with happiness. Padme laughs, and she and Anakin go on toward the house. The girls stay and play with little Artoo.","INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM (NABOO) - AFTERNOON","SOLA, Padme's beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.","SOLA: (over her shoulder) They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine.","Sola puts the bowl down on the table, where Anakin, Padme and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.","SOLA: Padme! (hugging her) You're late. Mom was worried. ","PADME: We walked. Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.","SOLA: Hello, Anakin.","ANAKIN: Hello.","Sola sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.","PADME: And this is my mother. ","JOBAL: You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, Anakin.","ANAKIN: A little.","PADME: He's being polite, Mom. We're starving.","RUWEE: (grinning) You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son.","Everyone sits and starts passing food.","JOBAL: (to Padme) Honey, it's so good to see you safe. We were so worried.","Padme gives her mother a dirty look. Ruwee smiles as he watches.","RUWEE: Dear...","JOBAL: I know, I know... but I had to say it. Now it's done.","SOLA: Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?","Padme blanches, and rolls her eyes at her sister. ","PADME: So-la!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.","JOVAL: A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme, they didn't tell us it was that serious'","PADME: It's not, Mom, I promise. (glances at Jobal) Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?","They nod.","PADME: (wryly) He grew up.","JOBAL: Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!","PADME: Mom, I'm not in any danger.","RUWEE: (to Anakin) Is she?","Anakin hesitates.","ANAKIN: Yes. I'm afraid she is.","PADME: (quickly) But not much.","EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON","Anakin and Ruwee are walking.","RUWEE: Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more... but I must say, I'm happy here.","ANAKIN: Padme tells me you teach at the university?","RUWEE: (nodding) Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement when I was very young.","ANAKIN: You seem quite interested in public service. ","RUWEE: Naboo is generous. We have all that we want, all that we could want. Food is plentiful, climate is comfortable, surroundings are ' ","ANAKIN: Beautiful. ","RUWEE: Quite so. We are a very fortunate people, and we know it. That good fortune shouldn't be taken for granted, so we try to share and try to help. In doing so, we become something larger than ourselves, and more fulfilled than one can become from idly enjoying good fortune. ","ANAKIN: It's the same with the Jedi, I suppose. We've been given great gifts, and we train hard to make the most of them. And then we use our powers to try to help the galaxy, to make everything a little bit better. ","RUWEE: And to make the things we love a little bit safer. ","Anakin smiles and nods. Ruwee looks at him with gratitude and respect. ","INT. NABERRIE LAKE RETREAT' DINING ROOM -- DAY","Padme, Sola, and Jobal are clearing the table. ","SOLA: Why haven't you told us about him?","PADME: What's there to talk about? He's just a boy. ","SOLA: A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?","PADME: Sola, stop it! ","SOLA: It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed?","PADME: I'm not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends' our relationship is strictly professional. ","Sola gives a knowing 'Sure it is' grin. ","PADME: Mom, would you tell her to stop it?","SOLA: (laughing) Well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.","PADME: Cut it out!!","JOBAL: Sola's just concerned'we all are. ","PADME: Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.","JOBAL: You've done your service, Padme. It's time you had a life of your own. You're missing so much!","EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN (NABOO) - AFTERNOON","Ruwee pauses in his walk, and Anakin stops as well. ","RUWEE: Now tell me, son'how serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in? ","ANAKIN: (hesitantly) There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. ","Ruwee is pained to hear this. ","ANAKIN: My master is tracking down the assassins, I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation won't last long. ","Ruwee nods, sadly. ","RUWEE: I don't want anything to happen to her'","ANAKIN: I don't either.  ","INT. NABERRIE LAKE RETREAT' DINING ROOM -- DAY","Padme and Sola are now alone in the room. Padme stares at her older sister with some exasperation. ","SOLA: What? ","PADME: Why do you keep saying such things about me and Anakin? ","SOLA: Because it's obvious. You see it ' you can't deny it. ","Padme sighs. ","SOLA: I thought Jedi weren't supposed to think such things. You think more like a Jedi than he does ' and you shouldn't. ","PADME: What do you mean? ","SOLA: You're so tied up in your responsibilities that you don't give any weight to your desires. ","PADME: You don't know how I feel about Anakin. ","SOLA: And neither do you ' because you won't let yourself think about it. It's funny ' you act as if you're prohibited and you're not, while Anakin acts as if he's under no such prohibitions, and he is! ","PADME: You're way ahead of everything! Anakin and I have only been together for a few days ' before that, I hadn't seen him in a decade! ","Sola shrugs and puts an arm around Padme's shoulder. ","SOLA: I know how he feels. And so do you. ","Padme gazes down at the floor, troubled. Sola lifts her chin and makes Padme face her. ","SOLA: It frightens you. What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of his feelings'or of your own? (beat) You're right, I don't know how you feel. But I suspect that it's something new to you. Something scary'but something wonderful. ","Padme can't answer that.","INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON","Padme throws some things into a bag.","PADME: Don't worry, this won't take long.","ANAKIN: I just want to get there before dark.","Padme goes on packing, and Anakin looks around the room.","ANAKIN: You still live at home.","PADME: I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.","ANAKIN: I never had a real home. Home was always where my mom was.","Anakin picks up a framed hologram and shows it to her.","ANAKIN: Is this you?","The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.","PADME: That was when I went with a relief group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means 'sweetheart.' He was so full of life... All those kids were. (somber) I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt. To live off their native planet.","Anakin picks up another hologram. It shows Padme at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.","PADME: My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?","Padme pulls a face, and Anakin grins. She continues packing. Anakin sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the stern, unsmiling adolescent.","EXT. SPACE ' NEAR KAMINO","The view is just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship leaps out of hyperspace and disengages from the hyperspace transport ring. The starship, painted red-and-white and wedge-shaped, flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.","INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE","Obi-Wan sits in the starship's cockpit, wearing a headset. He studies the console readouts. ","OBI-WAN: There it is, Arfour, right where it should be. Our missing planet, Kamino. Those files were altered. ","On the side of the ship, a red-and-white ARFOUR DROID beeps in worry. ","EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) ' DAY","Heavy rains and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world. ","The Starfighter lands. Obi-Wan gets out and makes his way through the howling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. Obi-Wan passes through it and goes inside. ","INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE -- DAY ","Brilliant white light. Obi-Wan pushes the soaking hood from his face. ","TAUN WE: Master Jedi, so good to see you. Welcome to Tipoca City.","OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. She has large almond shaped eyes, and speaks with a slow, melodic singsong voice.","TAUN WE: Everything is ready. The Prime Minister is expecting you.","OBI-WAN: (warily) I'm expected?!?","TAUN WE: Of course! He is anxious to meet you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way'","INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE ' DAY","The door slides open. Obi-Wan and Taun We enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises smiling from his chair, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.","TAUN WE: May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino. And this is Master Jedi ' ","OBI-WAN: Obi-Wan Kenobi. ","LAMA SU: Please'","Lama Su gestures to a seat, which Obi-Wan does not take. Lama Su sits as well, while Taun We hovers beside him. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech. ","LAMA SU: I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season. ","OBI-WAN: You make me feel most welcome. ","LAMA SU: (indicates the chair again) Please'? ","Obi-Wan finally sits down.","LAMA SU: And now to business: You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with a million more well on the way. ","Obi-Wan is lost, but improvises as best he can. ","OBI-WAN: That's'good news. ","LAMA SU: Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas that his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope.","OBI-WAN: I'm sorry? Master ' ?","LAMA SU: Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?","Obi-Wan is visibly puzzled. ","OBI-WAN: Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago. ","LAMA SU: Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that. But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him. ","OBI-WAN: The army'!?","LAMA SU: Yes ' a clone army. And I must say, one of the finest we've ever created. ","OBI-WAN: (thinking furiously) Tell me, Prime Minister' when my Master first contacted you about the army, did-did he say who it was for? ","LAMA SU: Of course he did. The army is for the Republic. ","Obi-Wan is visibly rocked by this. Lama Su stands up. ","LAMA SU: But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself. ","OBI-WAN: (grins and shrugs) That's why I'm here. ","Obi-Wan and Lama Su rise and walk toward the door. ","EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON","A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, docks at an island landing platform. Anakin and Padme disembark the water speeder at the base of a lodge rising on the beautiful island in the middle of the lake. ","EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACE -- LATE AFTERNOON","Anakin and Padme walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto the garden terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, Paddy Accu follows. Anakin and Padme stop at the balustrade. Padme looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. Anakin looks at her. ","PADME: When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water. ","ANAKIN: I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.","Padme suddenly becomes aware that Anakin is looking only at her. ","PADME: We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us, and try to guess the names of the birds singing.","ANAKIN: I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here'","Anakin touches Padme's arm, caressing it. Padme's intensely uncomfortable, but starting to like the attention in spite of herself. ","ANAKIN: Here everything's soft' and smooth'","PADME: There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand ' and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.","ANAKIN: Everything here is magical.","Padme keeps trying to avoid his gaze, but Anakin keeps bringing her eyes to meet his. ","PADME: You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real' but it wasn't.","ANAKIN: Sometimes'when you believe something to be real' it becomes real. ","Anakin flashes a dazzling, heart-melting smile. But Padme forces herself to continue with her story.","PADME: I used to think' if you looked too deeply into glass'you would lose yourself. ","ANAKIN: I think it's true. ","Slowly, tenderly, he kisses her. She doesn't resist' at first. She pulls away after a moment. ","PADME: No. I shouldn't have done that'","ANAKIN: I'm sorry'","He stares at the lake, a bewildered 'what did I do wrong' look on his face. ","INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY ' DAY","Obi-Wan is led by Lama Su and Taun We through a transparent glass tunnel to a vast clone hatchery all around them, where thousands upon thousands of translucent tubes can be seen, sticking out from the floor and ceiling at all angles, and an embryonic form in each of them. ","OBI-WAN: Very impressive.","LAMA SU: I'd hoped you would be pleased. Clones can think creatively. You'll find that they are immensely superior to droids.","Obi-Wan gazes at the nearest embryos.","OBI-WAN: How many are there'? ","LAMA SU: We have several hatcheries throughout the city. This, of course, is the most crucial phase ' though with our techniques, we expect a survival rate of over ninety percent. Every so often, an entire batch will develop a'an issue, but we expect production to remain steady, and with our accelerated growth methods, these before you will be fully matured and ready for battle in just over a decade. ","Obi-Wan can't suppress a shudder. Lama Su gestures far below the tunnel at a distant classroom. Inside, a group of small identical ten-year-old boys in blue outfits sit at desks and rapidly move complex puzzles into completion in mere seconds. There are patches on each of the children's shoulders. ","LAMA SU: We take great pride in our combat education and training programs. This group was created about five years ago. ","OBI-WAN: You mentioned growth acceleration...","LAMA SU: Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. The items you will soon see on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sifo-Dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature...","Lama Su points down at a large eating area. Seated and eating at tables are HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all physically about twenty years old, dressed in red outfits. They also have patches on their shoulders.  ","OBI-WAN: I see. ","LAMA SU: You'll find they are totally obedient, taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. ","The trio continue to walk down the glass tunnel. ","OBI-WAN: And who was the original host?","LAMA SU: A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sifo-Dyas handpicked Jango Fett himself.","Obi-Wan notes the words 'bounty hunter,' but keeps his expression neutral. ","OBI-WAN: And where is this bounty hunter now?","LAMA SU: Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.","The tour continues through a long corridor filled with narrow, transparent tubes into which clones are climbing. Once in the tube, the clone goes to sleep. The other side of the tunnel looks out upon a vast training area when clones of various ages go through rigorous martial arts matches.","OBI-WAN: Very disciplined. ","LAMA SU: That is the key. Disciplined, and yet able to think creatively. It is a mighty combination. Sifo-Dyas explained to us the Jedi aversion to leading droids. He told us Jedi could only command an army of life forms. ","OBI-WAN: So this Jango Fett willingly lives here? ","LAMA SU: The choice is his alone. Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn't it?","OBI-WAN: Unaltered?","The tour now moves over a vast grouping of lines. Several hundred adult clones, now in white armor, move to a conveyor belt where white helmets are rolling along. Each clone takes a helmet, dons it, and moves out. ","LAMA SU: Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...","OBI-WAN: I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.","TAUN WE: I would be very happy to arrange it for you.","Finally the tunnel ends, and Obi-Wan, Lama Su and Taun We come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS can be seen below, and each are wielding a blaster rifle. They move in perfect military formation, entire formations moving as one, in a stunning parade of might despite the pouring rain. ","LAMA SU: (beaming) Magnificent, aren't they? ","Obi-Wan nods slowly. He is both awed and terrified at the sight before him.","EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW ' LATE AFTERNOON","Padme and Anakin are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly. Beyond is the shimmering expanse of waterfalls of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. Padme is picking flowers. ","PADME: I don't know'","ANAKIN: Sure you do. You just don't want to tell me. ","PADME: Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?","ANAKIN: They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.","PADME: All right'I was twelve. His name was Palo. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older than I' very cute. Dark curly hair. Dreamy eyes. ","ANAKIN: All right, I get the picture'whatever happened to him? ","PADME: I went into public service. He went on to become an artist. ","ANAKIN: Maybe he was the smart one. ","PADME: (thoughtful) You really don't like politicians, do you? ","Anakin shrugs. ","ANAKIN: I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. ","Padme giggles. ","ANAKIN: I don't think the system works. ","PADME: How would you have it work? ","ANAKIN: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.","PADME: That's exactly what we do. Th-the trouble is that people don't always agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.","ANAKIN: Then they should be made to.","PADME: By whom? Who's going to make them?","ANAKIN: I don't know. Someone.\t","PADME: You?\t\t\t\t","ANAKIN: Of course not me.","PADME: But someone.","ANAKIN: Someone wise.\t","PADME: Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.","ANAKIN: Well' if it works'","She stares at him, confused. Anakin can't keep a straight face, and finally grins. Padme busts out laughing. ","PADME: (laughs) You're making fun of me! ","ANAKIN: (grinning) Oh no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.","PADME: You're so bad! ","She picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. Padme throws two more, and he catches them both. ","ANAKIN: You're always so serious'","PADME: I'm so serious?!?","Anakin then starts to juggle the fruit. Padme laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too. She throws more and more until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.","Anakin then gets up and stands in front of a Shaak, yelling at it and waving his arms. Padme starts laughing as Anakin runs in circles, chased by the Shaak.","EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW, LATE AFTERNOON","The Shaak crosses in front of Padme. Anakin is now standing on top of it, riding on its back. The Shaak bucks, and Anakin falls off. Padme laughs even harder. Anakin lies still, face down in the grass. Padme's smile fades. ","PADME: Ani ' ANI!! Are you all right? ","She jumps up and runs to where Anakin is lying and turns him over. He is laughing at her.

I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges.","Padme: Wait. Not here.","Anakin: Yes, here. I'm...I'm tired of all this deception.

Ani, I'm pregnant.","Anakin: That's...Well, that's won...That's wonderful.","Padme: What are we gonna do?","Anakin: We're not gonna worry about anything right now. All right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.","Grievous: Yes, Lord Sidious?","Palpatine: General Grievous... I suggest you move the separatist leaders to Mustafar.","Grievous: It will be done, my lord.","Palpatine: The end of the war is near, General.","Grievous: But the loss of Count Dooku...","Palpatine: His death was a necessary loss. Soon I will have a new apprentice... one far younger and more powerful.","Padme: Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We can go to the lake country where no one will know... where we can be safe. I can go early and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot. Right by the gardens.","Anakin: You are so... beautiful.","Padme: It's only because I'm so in love.","Anakin: No. No, it's because I'm so in love with you.","Padme: So love has blinded you?","Anakin: Well, that's not exactly what I meant.","Padme: But it's probably true.","Padme: Anakin, help me!","Padme: What's bothering you?","Anakin: Nothing. I remember when I gave this to you.","Padme: How long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other?","Anakin: It was a dream.","Padme: Bad?","Anakin: Like the ones I used to have about my mother...just before she died.","Padme: And?","Anakin: And it was about you.","Padme: Tell me.","Anakin: It was only a dream. You die in childbirth.","Padme: And the baby?","Anakin: I don't know.","Padme: It was only a dream.","Anakin: I won't let this one become real.","Padme: This baby will change our lives. I doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate. And if the council discovers you're the father, you'll be expelled...","Anakin: I...I know. I know.","Padme: Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?","Anakin: We don't need his help. Our baby is a blessing.","Yoda: Premonitions? Premonitions. Hmm. These visions you have...","Anakin: They're of pain, suffering.","Yoda: Death. Yourselfyou speak of, or someoneyou know?","Anakin: Someone.","Yoda: Close to you?","Anakin: Yes.","Yoda: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.","Anakin: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.","Yoda: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is.","Anakin: What must I do, Master Yoda?","Yoda: Train yourself to let go...of everything you fear to lose.","Obi-Wan: You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.","Anakin: I'm sorry. I was held up. I have no excuse.","Obi-Wan: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.","Anakin: What's wrong, then?","Obi-Wan: The senate is expected...to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.","Anakin: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It'll make it easier for us to end this war.","Obi-Wan: Be careful of your friend Palpatine.","Anakin: Be careful of what?","Obi-Wan: He has requested your presence.","Anakin: What for?","Obi-Wan: He would not say.","Anakin: He didn't inform the council? That's unusual, isn't it?","Obi-Wan: All of this is unusual. And it's making me feel uneasy.","Palpatine: I hope you trust me, Anakin.","Anakin: Of course.","Palpatine: I need your help, son.","Anakin: What do you mean?","Palpatine: I'm depending on you.","Anakin: For what? I don't understand.","Palpatine: To be the eyes, ears and voice ofthe Republic. Anakin...I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.","Anakin: Me? A master? I'm overwhelmed, sir. But the council elects its own members. They'll never accept this.","Palpatine: I think they will. They need you. More than you know.","Yoda: Allow this appointment lightly the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.","Anakin: I understand.","Mace: You are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.","Anakin: What? How can you do this? This is outrageous. It's unfair. How can you be on the council and not be a master?","Mace: Take a seat, young Skywalker.","Anakin: Forgive me, Master.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic...but have found no sign of General Grievous.","Yoda: Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is. The outlying systems you must sweep.","Obi-Wan: We do not have many ships to spare.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?","Mace: It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.","Obi-Wan: He's right. It's a system we cannot afford to lose.","Yoda: Go I will. Good relations with the Wookiees I have.","Mace: It's settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones... to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.","Anakin: What kind of nonsense is this? Put me on the council and not make me a master? It's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.","Obi-Wan: Oh, calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the council atyour age... it's never happened before. The fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor. The council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.","Anakin: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council.","Obi-Wan: But it's what you wanted. Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.","Anakin: That has nothing to do with this.","Obi-Wan: The only reason the council has approved your appointment... is because the chancellor trusts you.","Anakin: And?","Obi-Wan: Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't want to putyou in this situation.","Anakin: What situation?","Obi-Wan: The council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.","Anakin: They want me to spy on the chancellor? But that's treason.","Obi-Wan: We are at war, Anakin.","Anakin: Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?","Obi-Wan: This assignment is not to be on record.","Anakin: The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.","Obi-Wan: That is why you must help us. Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader... who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.","Anakin: The senate demanded that he stay longer.","Obi-Wan: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.","Anakin: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code... against the Republic, against a mentor and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this ofme?","Obi-Wan: The council is asking you.","Obi-Wan: Anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm.","Mace: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.","Obi-Wan: With all due respect, Master, is he not the chosen one? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?","Mace: So the prophecy says.","Yoda: A prophecy that misread could have been.","Obi-Wan: He will not let me down. He never has.","Yoda: I hope right you are.","Anakin: Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order. I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.","Padme: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?","Anakin: What do you mean?","Padme: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists... and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?","Anakin: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a separatist.","Padme: This war represents a failure to listen. Nowyou're closer to the chancellor than anyone. Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.","Anakin: Don't ask me to do that. Make a motion in the senate, where that kind ofa request belongs.","Padme: What is it?","Anakin: Nothing.","Padme: Don't do this. Don't shut me out. Let me help you. Hold me. Like you did by the lake on Naboo. So long ago, when there was nothing but our love. No politics, no plotting, no war.","Anakin: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.","Palpatine: Yes, Anakin. Come closer. I have good news.","Palpatine: Our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He's hiding in the Utapau system.","Anakin: At last. We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.","Palpatine: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council... if it didn't select you for this assignment. You're the best choice, by far.","Palpatine: Hmm. Sit down. Leave us.","Palpatine: Anakin...you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.","Anakin: I'm not sure I understand.","Palpatine: You must sense what I have come to suspect. The Jedi Council want control ofthe Republic. They're planning to betray me.","Anakin: I don't think that...","Palpatine: Anakin. Search your feelings. You know, don't you?","Anakin: I know they don't trust you.","Palpatine: Hmm. Or the senate. Or the Republic, or democracy, for that matter.","Anakin: I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.","Palpatine: Why? They asked you to do something... that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?","Anakin: I don't, uh...I don't know what to say.","Palpatine: Remember back to your early teachings. All who gain power are afraid to lose it. Even the Jedi.","Anakin: The Jedi use their power for good.","Palpatine: Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost everyway...including their quest for greater power.","Anakin: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards... only about themselves.","Palpatine: And the Jedi don't?","Anakin: The Jedi are selfless. They only care about others.","Palpatine: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?","Anakin: No.","Palpatine: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.","Palpatine: Darth Plagueis... was a dark lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise...he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians...to create... Iife.","Palpatine: He had such a knowledge ofthe dark side... he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying.","Anakin: He could actually...save people from death?","Palpatine: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities...some consider to be unnatural.","Anakin: Wh...What happened to him?","Palpatine: He became so powerful...the only thing he was afraid of was...Iosing his power. Which eventually, of course, he did.","Palpatine: Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.","It's ironic. He could save others from death...but not himself.","Anakin: Is it possible to learn this power?","Palpatine: Not from a Jedi.","Clone Commander: All Redunits, overhere!","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?","Anakin: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet...from the chairman of Utapau.","Yoda: Hmm. Act on this we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.","Anakin: The chancellor has requested...that I lead the campaign.","Mace: The council will make up its own mind who is to go...not the chancellor.","Yoda: A master is needed, with more experience.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.","Yoda: I agree.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Aye.","Mace: Aye. Verywell. Council adjourned.","Clone Commander Gree: The droids have started up their main power generators.","Yoda: Then now the time is, Commander.","Clone Commander Gree: Yes, sir.","B1 Battle Droid: Charge!","Clone: Headfor cover!","Anakin: You're gonna need me on this one, Master.","Obi-Wan: Oh, I agree. However, it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.","Anakin: Master. I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been very appreciative ofyour training. I've been arrogant, and I apologize. I've just been so frustrated with the council.","Obi-Wan: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be. But be patient, Anakin. It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master.","Anakin: Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.","Obi-Wan: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.","Clone Commander Cody: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here. On the far side.","Obi-Wan: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.","Clone Commander Cody: Come on. When have I ever let you down?","Obi-Wan: Verywell. The burden is on me not to destroy all the droids until you arrive.","Obi-Wan: Save your energy.","Padme: I can't.","Obi-Wan: Don't give up, Padme.","Anakin: Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?","Padme: He came by this morning.","Anakin: What did he want?","Padme: He's worried about you. He says you've been under a lot of stress.","Anakin: I feel lost.","Padme: Lost? What do you mean?","Anakin: Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.","Padme: They trust you with their lives.","Anakin: Something's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't.","Padme: You expect too much of yourself.","Anakin: I found a way to save you.","Padme: Save me?","Anakin: From my nightmares.","Padme: Is that what's bothering you?","Anakin: I won't lose you, Padme.","Padme: I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani. I promise you.","Anakin: No, I promiseyou.","Tion Medon: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?","Obi-Wan: Unfortunately, the war.","Tion Medon: There's no war here...unless you brought it with you.","Obi-Wan: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel...and to use your city as a base as I searchnearby systems for General Grievous.","Tion Medon: He is here. We are being held hostage. They are watching us.","Obi-Wan: I understand.","Tion Medon: Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.","Obi-Wan: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.","Obi-Wan: Take the fighter back to the ship. Tell Cody I've made contact.","Pau'an Body Guard: Is he bringing additional warriors?","Tion Medon: He didn't say.","Grievous: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outerrim. It is a volcanic planet. You will be safe there.","Nute: Safe? Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General. Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.","Grievous: Be thankful, Viceroy...you have not found yourself in my grip. Your ship is waiting.","Obi-Wan: Hello there.","Grievous: General Kenobi. You are a bold one. Kill him.","Grievous: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.","Obi-Wan: Your move.","Grievous: You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku. Attack, Kenobi.","Grievous: Army or not...you must realize you are doomed.","Obi-Wan: Oh, I don't think so.","B1 Battle Droid: Uh-oh.","Obi-Wan: Hyah!","Clone Trooper: Cover that corner.","Clone Commander Cody: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous... and we have begun our attack.","Mace: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.","Anakin: Yes, Master.","Mace: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous... then he should be removed from office.","Mace: The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate... in order to secure a peaceful transition.","Yoda: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmm. Great care we must take.","Anakin: Chancellor. We've just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.","Palpatine: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.","Anakin: I should be there with him.","Palpatine: It's upsetting to me to see that the council...doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi master?","Anakin: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that...I'm being excluded from the council. I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me.","Palpatine: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you.","Palpatine: Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.","Anakin: How do you know the ways ofthe Force?","Palpatine: My mentor taught me everything about the Force. Even the nature of the dark side.","Anakin: You know the dark side?","Palpatine: Anakin...if one is to understand the great mystery...one must studyall its aspects...not just the dogmatic narrow view oftheJedi.","Palpatine: If you wish to become a complete and wise leader...you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.","Palpatine: Only through me...can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force...and you will be able to save yourwife...from certain death.","Anakin: What did you say?","Palpatine: Use my knowledge. I beg you.","Anakin: You're the Sith lord.","Palpatine: I know what's been troubling you. Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council. Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life... greater than that ofan ordinary Jedi. A life of significance...of conscience.","Palpatine: Areyou going to kill me?","Anakin: I would certainly like to.","Palpatine: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus...makes you stronger.","Anakin: I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.","Palpatine: Of course. You should. But you're not sure of their intentions, areyou?","Anakin: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.","Palpatine: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. Power to save Padme.","Grievous: Aaah!","Obi-Wan: So uncivilized.","Anakin: Master Windu, I must talk to you.","Mace: Skywalker, we just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We're on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate.","Anakin: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.","Mace: A Sith lord?","Anakin: Yes. The one we've been looking for.","Mace: How do you know this?","Anakin: He knows the ways of the Force. He's been trained to use the dark side.","Mace: Are you sure?","Anakin: Absolutely.","Mace: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive.","Anakin: Master, the chancellor is very powerful. You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.","Mace: For you own good, stay out ofthis affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.","Anakin: I must go, Master.","Mace: No. If what you've told me is true...you will have gained my trust. But for now, remain here. Wait in the council chambers until we return.","Anakin: Yes, Master.","Palpatine: You do know, don't you...if the Jedi destroy me...any chance of saving her will be lost.","Palpatine: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say you're here sooner than expected.","Mace: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic... you're under arrest, Chancellor.","Palpatine: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?","Mace: The senate will decide your fate.","Palpatine: I am the senate.","Mace: Not yet.","Palpatine: It's treason then.","Mace: You are under arrest, my lord.","Palpatine: Anakin, I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.","Mace: The oppression of the Sith will never return. You have lost.","Palpatine: No. No. No. You will die!","Palpatine: He's a traitor!","Mace; He is the traitor!","Palpatine: I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose.","Mace: Don't listen to him, Anakin!","Palpatine: Don't let him kill me. I can't hold it any longer. I...I...I...I can't. I...I...I'm weak. I'm...I'm too weak.","Palpatine: Anakin. Help me. Help me! I...I...I can't hold on any longer.","Mace: I am going to end this once and for all.","Anakin: You can't. He must stand trial.","Mace: He has control of the senate and the courts. He's too dangerous to be left alive.","Palpatine: I'm too weak. Oh. Don't kill me. Please.","Anakin: It's not the Jedi way. He must live.","Palpatine: Please don't.","Anakin: I need him.","Palpatine: Please don't!","Anakin: No!","Palpatine: Power! Unlimited power!","Anakin: What have I done?","Palpatine: You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.","Anakin: I will do whatever you ask.","Palpatine: Good.","Anakin: Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her.","Palpatine: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved... but if we work together... I know we can discover the secret.","Anakin: I pledge myself... to your teachings.","Palpatine: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you.","Palpatine: A powerful Sith you will become.","Palpatine: Henceforth you shall be known as...Darth...Vader.","Anakin: Thankyou, my master.","Palpatine: Rise.","Palpatine: Because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice...I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot.","Palpatine: When the Jedi learn what has transpired here...they will kill us...along with all the senators.","Anakin: I agree.","Palpatine: The council's next move willbe against the senate. Every single Jedi...including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...is now an enemy of the Republic.","Anakin: I understand, Master.","Palpatine: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless. If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end.","Palpatine: First I want you to go to the Jedi temple. We will catch them off-balance.","Palpatine: Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.","Palpatine: Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side...to save Padme.","Anakin: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?","Palpatine: Their betrayal will be dealt with. Afteryou have killed all the Jedi in the temple...go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...and the other separatist leaders.","Palpatine: Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy! And...we shall have... peace.","Clone Trooper: Sergeant, over here! Hurry! Follow them!","Clone Trooper: All Red units, let's move it!","Clone Trooper: Come on. Let's go!","Obi-Wan: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.","Clone Commander Cody: Very good, sir. Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.","Obi-Wan: Thank you, Cody. Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here. Hyah!","Clone Commander Cody: Yes, sir.","Palpatine: Commander Cody...the time has come. Execute order 66.","Clone Commander Cody: Yes, my lord. Blast him!","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Come on!","Palpatine: Execute order 66.","Clone Jag and CT-57/11-9048: It will be done, my lord.","Clone Commander Bly: It will be done, my lord.","Sors Bandeam: Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?","C-3PO: The chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple. Don't worry. I...I'm sure he'll be all right.","Bail Organa: What's going on here?","Clone Officer Appo: There's been a rebellion, sir. Don't worry. The situation is under control. I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.","Bail Organa: And so it is.","Clone Officer Appo: Get him!","Bail Organa: No!","Clone Officer Appo: Don't worry about him. Let him go.","Clone Sergeant: All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.","Clone Trooper: Yes, sir.","Yoda: Good-bye, Tarfful. Good-bye, Chewbacca. Miss you I will.","Bail Organa: Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a fewJedi...before they walk into this catastrophe.","Clone Commander Cody: Did you find Kenobi?","Clone Trooper: Sir, no one could have survived that fall.","Clone Commander Cody: Start loading your men on the ships. Move it.","Obi-Wan: Emergency code 91 3. I have no contact on any frequency.","Bail Organa: Master Kenobi.","Obi-Wan: Repeat.","Bail Organa: Master Kenobi.","Obi-Wan: Senator Organa. My clone troops turned on me. I need help.","Bail Organa: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.","C-3PO: Hush! Not so loud.","Padme: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple. You could see the smoke from here.","Anakin: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.","Padme: What's happening?","Anakin: The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic.","Padme: I can't believe that.","Anakin: I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself.","Padme: Oh, Anakin. What are you gonna do?","Anakin: I will not betray the Republic. My loyalties lie with the chancellor...and with the senate and with you.","Padme: What about Obi-Wan?","Anakin: I don't know. Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.","Padme: Anakin, I'm afraid.","Anakin: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The chancellor has given me a very important mission.","Anakin: The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return. Things will be different. I promise.","Anakin: Please, wait for me.","C-3PO: Well, he is under a lot ofstress, R2. Take care, my little friend.","C-3PO: Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?","Padme: No, thank you, 3PO.","C-3PO: Oh. I...I feel so helpless.","Obi-Wan: How many other Jedi have managed to survive?","Yoda: Heard from no one have we.","Bail Organa: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.","Obi-Wan: Have we had any contact from the temple?","Yoda: Received a coded retreat message we have.","Bail Organa: It requests all Jedi to return to the temple. It says the war is over.","Obi-Wan: Well, then we must go back. If there are any stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.","Yoda: Hmm. Suggest dismantling the coded signal, doyou?","Obi-Wan: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.","Yoda: I agree. And a little more knowledge might light ourway.","Nute: The plan has gone as you had promised, my lord.","Palpatine: You have done well, Viceroy.","Palpatine: When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives... he will take care of you.","Bail Organa's Pilot: We're receiving a message from the chancellor's office, sir.","Bail Organa: Send it through.","Bail Organa's Pilot: Yes, sir.","Mas Ameda: Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor requests your presence...at a special session of Congress.","Bail Organa: I will be there.","Mas Ameda: He'll be expecting you.","Bail Organa: Could be a trap.","Obi-Wan: I don't think so. The chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems... without keeping the senate intact.","Bail Organa: If a special session of Congress there is...easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be.","Anakin: R2, stay with the ship.","Nute: Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.","Palpatine: And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.","Bail Organa: What's happened?","Padme: The chancellor's been elaborating...on a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.","Palpatine: The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.","Obi-Wan: Not even the younglings survived.","Yoda: Killed not by clones...this Padawan. By a lightsaber he was.","Obi-Wan: Who? Who could have done this?","Palpatine: The attempt on my life...has left me scarred...and deformed.But I assure you. My resolve has never been stronger!","Rune: Stop! No!","Palpatine: In order to ensure the security...and continuing stability...the Republic will be reorganized...into the first Galactic Empire! For a safe...and secure society.","Padme: So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause.","Nute: The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want...","Obi-Wan: I have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.","Yoda: For the clones...to discover the recalibration a long time it will take.","Obi-Wan: Wait. Master. There is something I must know.","Yoda: If into the security recordings you go...only pain will you find.","Obi-Wan: I must know the truth, Master.","Obi-Wan: It can't be. It can't be.","Palpatine: You have done well, my new apprentice. Now, Lord Vader...go and bring peace to the Empire.","Obi-Wan: I can't watch any more.","Yoda: Destroy the Sith we must.","Obi-Wan: Send me to kill the emperor. I will not kill Anakin.","Yoda: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not.","Obi-Wan: He is like my brother. I cannot do it.","Yoda: Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is. Consumed by Darth Vader.","Obi-Wan: I do not know where the emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.","Yoda: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will.","Obi-Wan: When was the last time you saw him?","Padme: Yesterday.","Obi-Wan: And do you know where he is now?","Padme: No.","Obi-Wan: Padme, I need your help. He is in grave danger.","Padme: From the Sith?","Obi-Wan: From himself. Padme...Anakin has turned to the dark side.","Padme: You're wrong. How could you even say that?","Obi-Wan: I have seen a...a security hologram...of him...killing younglings.","Padme: Not Anakin. He couldn't.","Obi-Wan: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith lord we've been looking for.","Obi-Wan: After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.","Padme: I don't believe you. I can't.","Obi-Wan: Padme...I must find him.","Padme: You're going to kill him, aren't you?","Obi-Wan: He has become a very great threat.","Padme: I can't.","Obi-Wan: Anakin is the father, isn't he? I'm so sorry.","Captain Typho: Milady, let me come with you.","Padme: There's no danger. The fighting's over. And this is personal.","Captain Typho: As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree.","Padme: I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, 3PO will look after me.","C-3PO: Oh, dear. Do you know? I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business. Hmm.","Anakin: The separatists have been taken care of, my master.","Palpatine: It is finished then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.","Palpatine: Send a message to the ships ofthe Trade Federation. All droid units must shut down immediately.","Anakin: Very good, my lord.","Anakin: I saw your ship. What are you doing out here?","Padme: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.","Anakin: What things?","Padme: He said you've turned to the dark side. That you...killed younglings.","Anakin: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.","Padme: He cares about us.","Anakin: Us?","Padme: He knows. He wants to help you.","Padme: Anakin, all I want is your love.","Anakin: Love won't saveyou, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.","Padme: At what cost? You're a good person. Don't do this.","Anakin: I won't loseyou the way I lost my mother.","Anakin: I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of. And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.","Padme: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.","Anakin: Don't you see? We don't have to run away anymore.","Anakin: I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the chancellor. I...I can overthrow him.","Anakin: And together, you and I can rule the galaxy...make things the way we want them to be.","Padme: I don't believe what I'm hearing. Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.","Anakin: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.","Anakin: The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.","Padme: I don't know you anymore. Anakin...you're breaking my heart. You're going down a path I can't follow.","Anakin: Because of Obi-Wan?","Padme: Because of what you've done. What you plan to do. Stop. Stop now. Come back. I love you.","Anakin: Liar!","Padme: No.","Anakin: You're with him! You brought him here to kill me.","Padme: No.","Obi-Wan: Let her go, Anakin. Anakin. Let her go.","Anakin: You turned her against me!","Obi-Wan: You have done that yourself.","Anakin: You will not take her from me!","Obi-Wan: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.","Obi-Wan: You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now- until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.","Anakin: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi.","Anakin: I do not fear the dark side as you do.","Anakin: I have brought peace...freedom, justice...and security to my new empire.","Obi-Wan: Your new empire?","Anakin: Don't make me kill you.","Obi-Wan: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!","Anakin: If you're not with me...then you're my enemy.","Obi-Wan: Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.","Anakin: You will try.","Yoda: I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor. Or should I call you Darth Sidious?","Palpatine: MasterYoda. You survived.","Yoda: Surprised?","Palpatine: Your arrogance blinds you, MasterYoda. Nowyou will experience...the full power of the dark side.","Palpatine: I have waited a long time...for this moment...my little green friend.","Palpatine: At last the Jedi are no more.","Yoda: Not if anything to say about it I have.","Palpatine: Aaah!","Yoda: At an end your rule is. And not short enough it was.","Yoda: If so powerful you are...why leave?","Palpatine: You will not stop me. Darth Vaderwill become more powerful than either of us.","Yoda: Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be. As is your faith in the dark side ofthe Force.","Yoda: Hurry. Careful timing we will need.","Bail Organa: Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.","Clone Commander Thire: There's no sign of his body, sir.","Mas Ameda: Then he is not dead.","Palpatine: Double your search.","Clone Commander Thire: Yes, sir. Right away, sir.","Palpatine: Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.","Mas Ameda: Yes, Master.","Palpatine: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.","Yoda: Into exile I must go. Failed I have.","Obi-Wan: I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you.","Anakin: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over.","Obi-Wan: Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!","Anakin: From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.","Obi-Wan: Well, then you are lost!","Anakin: This is the end for you, my master.","Obi-Wan: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.","Anakin: You underestimate my power.","Obi-Wan: Don't try it.","Obi-Wan: You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them!","Obi-Wan: Bring balance to the Force...not leave it in darkness!","Anakin: I hate you!","Obi-Wan: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.","C-3PO: Oh. Master Kenobi. Um, we have Miss Padme on board. Yes. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.","Padme: Obi-Wan. Is Anakin all right?","Clone Captain Kagi: Your Majesty, this way.","Palpatine: There he is. He's still alive.","Palpatine: Get a medical capsule immediately.","Clone Captain Kagi: Yes, sir. Right away.","Bail Organa: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.","Bail Organa: We'll take her to the medical center. Quickly.","GH-7 Medical Analysis Unit: Medically, she's completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.","Obi-Wan: She's dying?","GH-7 Medical Analysis Unit: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.","Bail Organa: Babies?","GH-7 Medical Analysis Unit: She's carrying twins.","Midwife Droid: Ee-see-tah oy-doh.","Padme: Luke. Oh, Luke.","Midwife Droid: Ooh-bah, ooh-bah. Ee-see-tah oy-dah.","Obi-Wan: It's a girl.","Padme: Leia.","Padme: Obi-Wan? There's good in him. I know. I know there's...still...","Palpatine: Lord Vader. Can you hear me?","Anakin: Yes, Master. Where is Padme? Is she safe? Is she all right?","Palpatine: It seems, in your anger, you killed her.","Anakin: I? I couldn't have. She was alive. I felt it! No!","Yoda: Hidden, safe the children must be kept.","Obi-Wan: We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence.","Yoda: Hmm. Split up they should be.","Bail Organa: My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.","Obi-Wan: And what of the boy?","Yoda: To Tatooine. To his family send him.","Obi-Wan: I will take the child and watch over him.","Yoda: Until the time is right, disappear we will.","Yoda: Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.","Obi-Wan: Training?","Yoda: An old friend has learned the path to immortality. One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force. Your old master.","Obi-Wan: Qui-Gon?","Yoda: How to commune with him I will teach you.","Bail Organa: Captain Antilles.","Raymus Antilles: Yes, Your Highness?","Bail Organa: I'm placing these droids in your care.
