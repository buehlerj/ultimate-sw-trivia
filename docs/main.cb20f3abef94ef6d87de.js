This is my apprentice, Darth Maul. He will find your lost ship.","Nute Gunray: This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them.","Rune Haako: We should not have made this bargain.","Captain Panaka: An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.","Sabe: It is to be commended. What is its number?","Captain Panaka: R2-D2, Your Highness.","Sabe: Thank you, R2-D2.","Sabe: Padm\xe9. Clean this droid up as best you can. It deserves our gratitude.","Sabe: Continue, Captain.","Qui-Gon: Your Highness, with your permission, we're heading for a remote planet called Tatooine. It's in a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation.","Captain Panaka: I do not agree with the Jedi on this.","Qui-Gon: You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.","Jar-Jar: Hello. Sorry. Husa are yousa?","Padme: I'm Padm\xe9.","Jar-Jar: Mesa JarJar Binks.","Padme: You're a Gungan, aren't you?","Jar-Jar: Uh-huh.","Padme: How'd you end up here with us?","Jar-Jar: My no know. Mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning munchen. Den boom! Getten berry scared and grabben dat Jedi, and pow... mesa here. Huh. Mesa getten berry, berry scared.","Ric Olie: That's it... Tatooine.","Obi-Wan: There's a settlement.","Qui-Gon: Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract attention.","Obi-Wan: The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master. We'll need a new one.","Qui-Gon: That'll complicate things. Be wary. I sense a disturbance in the Force.","Obi-Wan: I feel it also, Master.","Qui-Gon: Don't let them send any transmissions.","Jar-Jar: This sun doen murder to mesa skin.","Captain Panaka: Wait! Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you.","Qui-Gon: No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.","Captain Panaka: The queen wishes it. She's curious about the planet.","Qui-Gon: This is not a good idea. Stay close to me.","Qui-Gon: Moisture farms, for the most part. Some indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few space ports like this one are havens for those that don't wish to be found.","Padme: Like us.","Jar-Jar: Dissen berry berry bad. Oh! Icky icky goo!","Qui-Gon: We'll try one of the smaller dealers.","Watto: Good day to you. What do you want?","Qui-Gon: I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.","Watto: Ah, yes! Nubian. We have lots of that.","Watto: Boy, get in here now!","Qui-Gon: My droid has a readout of what I need.","Watto: What took you so long?","Anakin: I was cleaning the fan switches.","Watto: Watch the store. I've got some selling to do.","Watto: So... let me take thee out back, huh? Ni you'll find what you need.","Jar-Jar: Hmm?","Qui-Gon: Don't touch anything.","Jar-Jar: Hmph! Hmm.","Anakin: Are you an angel?","Padme: What?","Anakin: An angel. I heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They're the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They live on the moons of Iego, I think.","Padme: You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?","Anakin: I listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here. I'm a pilot, you know, and someday I'm gonna fly away from this place.","Padme: You're a pilot?","Anakin: Mm-hmm. All my life.","Padme: How long have you been here?","Anakin: Since I was very little. Three, I think. My mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us betting on the Podraces.","Padme: You're a slave?","Anakin: I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.","Padme: I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. This is a strange place to me.","Jar-Jar: Hmm. Hmm. Where... Wheres yousa goin? I got ya.","Anakin: Hey!","Jar-Jar: What?","Anakin: Hit the nose.","Watto: A T-14 hyperdrive generator. Thee in luck. I'm the only one hereabouts who has one. But thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think, huh?","Watto: Saying of which, how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?","Qui-Gon: I have 20,000 Republic dataries.","Watto: Republic credits? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real.","Qui-Gon: I don't have anything else, but credits will do fine.","Watto: No, they won't.","Qui-Gon: Credits will do fine.","Watto: No, they won't! What, you think you're some kind of Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don't work on me. Only money.","Watto: No money, no parts, no deal.","Watto: And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.","Anakin: Wouldn't have lasted long anyways if I wasn't so good at building things.","Jar-Jar: Aw! Ooh!! Ai, ai! Whoa, ai!","Qui-Gon: We're leaving. JarJar.","Jar-Jar: Whaaa!","Padme: I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.","Anakin: I was glad to meet you too.","Jar-Jar: What? Wha... Oh.","Watto: Outlanders. They think we know nothing.","Anakin: They seemed nice to me.","Watto: Clean the racks. Then you can go home.","Anakin: Yippee!","Qui-Gon: And you're sure there's nothing left on board?","Obi-Wan: A few containers of supplies. The queen's wardrobe, maybe, but not enough for you to barter with, not in the amount you're talking about.","Qui-Gon: All right. I'm sure another solution will present itself. I'll check back later.","Jar-Jar: Noah gain! Noah gain. Da beings hereabouts, cawazy! Wesa be wobbed un crunched!","Qui-Gon: Not likely. We have nothing of value. That's our problem.","Jar-Jar: Hmm? Ah, mooie-mooie.","Gragra: Hey, hey! Are you going to pay for that?","Jar-Jar: Huh? Wanga?","Gragra: It costs seven wupiupi.","Sebulba: Ah! Chubaa...","Jar-Jar: Oops.","Sebulba: Is this yours?","Jar-Jar: Who, mesa? Ouch! Ouch!","Anakin: Careful, Sebulba. He's a big-time outlander. I'd hate to see you diced before we race again.","Sebulba: Next time we race, boy, it will be the end of you. If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now.","Anakin: Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me.","Anakin: Hi.","Qui-Gon: Hi there.","Anakin: Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug, an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.","Jar-Jar: Mesa haten crunchen. Das da las ting mesa want.","Qui-Gon: Nevertheless, the boy is right. You were heading into trouble. Thanks, my young friend.","Jar-Jar: But... But...But mesa doen notin!","Obi-Wan: This storm will slow them down.","Captain Panaka: Looks pretty bad. Panaka.","Ric Olie: Receiving a message from home.","Captain Panaka: We'll be right there.","Anakin: Here, you'll like these pallies. Here.","Qui-Gon: Thank you.","Jira: Oh, my bones are aching. Storm's coming up, Ani. You better get home quick.","Anakin: Do you have shelter?","Qui-Gon: We'll head back to our ship.","Anakin: Is it far?","Padme: It's on the outskirts.","Anakin: You'll never reach the outskirts in time. Sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come on. I'll take you to my place.","Anakin: Mom! Mom, I'm home!","Jar-Jar: Ahh, dissen cosy.","Anakin: These are my friends, Mom.","Jar-Jar: Hello.","Qui-Gon: I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.","Anakin: I'm building a droid. You wanna see?","Qui-Gon: Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.","Anakin: Come on. I'll show you 3PO.","Jar-Jar: Oh, mooie-mooie.","Anakin: Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.","Padme: He's wonderful.","Anakin: You really like him? He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.","C-3PO: Oh. Oh. Uh...Where is everybody?","Anakin: Whoops. Yeah.","C-3PO: Oh, hello. I am C-3 PO, human-cyborg relations. How might I serve you?","Padme: He's perfect.","C-3PO: Oh. Perfect.","Anakin: When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer. I'm building a Podracer.","C-3PO: I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.","C-3PO: Oh, hello. I don't believe we have been introduced.","C-3PO: R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.","C-3PO: I beg your pardon, but what do you mean, 'naked'? My parts are showing? My goodness! Oh!","Sio Bibble: The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me.","Obi-Wan: It's a trick. Send no reply. Send no transmissions of any kind.","Qui-Gon: It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.","Obi-Wan: What if it is true, and the people are dying?","Qui-Gon: Either way, we're running out of time.","Darth Maul: Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.","Palpatine: Move against the Jedi first. You will then have no difficulty in taking the queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.","Darth Maul: At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.","Palpatine: You have been well-trained, my young apprentice. They will be no match for you.","Shmi: All slaves have a transmitter placed inside their bodies somewhere.","Anakin: I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.","Shmi: Any attempt to escape...","Anakin: And they blow you up! Boom!","Jar-Jar: How wude!","Padme: I can't believe there's still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's antislavery laws...","Shmi: The Republic doesn't exist out here. We must survive on our own.","Jar-Jar: Xcuse me.","Anakin: Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?","Qui-Gon: They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.","Anakin: I'm the only human who can do it.","Qui-Gon: You must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods.","Qui-Gon: Don't do that again.","Anakin: You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?","Qui-Gon: What makes you think that?","Anakin: I saw your laser sword. Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.","Qui-Gon: Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.","Anakin: I don't think so. No one can kill a Jedi.","Qui-Gon: I wish that were so.","Anakin: I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves. Have you come to free us?","Qui-Gon: No, I'm afraid not.","Anakin: I think you have. Why else would you be here?","Qui-Gon: I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin. We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission.","Anakin: How did you end up out here in the outer rim?","Padme: Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.","Anakin: I can help. I can fix anything.","Qui-Gon: I believe you can. But first we must acquire the parts we need.","Jar-Jar: Wit no-nutten mula to trade.","Padme: These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.","Shmi: Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.","Qui-Gon: Podracing. Greed can be a powerful ally.","Anakin: I built a racer. It's the fastest ever. There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod.","Shmi: Anakin! Watto won't let you.","Anakin: Watto doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it was yours and get him to let me pilot it for you.","Shmi: I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.","Anakin: But, Mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.","Shmi: Anakin.","Qui-Gon: Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who can help us?","Shmi: No.","Anakin: Mom, you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other.","Padme: I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way.","Shmi: No. There is no other way. I may not like it, but he can help you. He was meant to help you.","Padme: Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know? The queen will not approve.","Qui-Gon: The queen doesn't need to know.","Padme: Well, I don't approve.","Watto: The boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race. How can you do this? Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?","Qui-Gon: My ship will be the entry fee.","Watto: Oh, not bad! Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?","Qui-Gon: It's in good order, except for the parts I need.","Watto: What would the boy ride? He smashed up my pod in the last race. It will take some long time to fix it.","Anakin: It wasn't my fault, really. Sebulba flashed me with his vents. I actually saved the pod, mostly.","Watto: Mmm. That you did, huh. The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?","Qui-Gon: I have acquired a pod in a game of chance, the fastest ever built.","Watto: I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh?","Watto: So, you supply the pod and the entry fee, and I supply the boy. We split the winnings, um, 50-50, I think, huh?","Qui-Gon: If it's going to be 50-50, I suggest you front the cash for the entry.","Qui-Gon: If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need. And if we lose, you keep my ship. Either way, you win.","Watto: Deal! Your friend is a foolish one, me thinks.","Obi-Wan: What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here a very long time.","Qui-Gon: Well, it's too dangerous to call for help, and a ship without a power supply isn't going to get us anywhere.","Qui-Gon: And...there's something about this boy.","Qui-Gon: You should be very proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward.","Shmi: Well, he knows nothing of greed. He has a...","Qui-Gon: He has special powers.","Shmi: Yes.","Qui-Gon: He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It's a Jedi trait.","Shmi: He deserves better than a slave's life.","C-3PO: Why, certainly.","Qui-Gon: Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early.","Qui-Gon: The Force is unusually strong with him. That much is clear. Who was his father?","Shmi: There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him. I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?","Qui-Gon: I don't know. I didn't actually come here to free slaves.","Kids: Hey. Hi, Ani. Hi.","Kitster: Wow, a real astro droid. How did you get so lucky?","Anakin: That isn't the half of it. I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.","Kitster: What? With this?","W. Wald: You're such a joker, Ani.","Kids: You've been working on that thing for years. It's never gonna run. Come on. Let's go and play ball. Keep racing, Ani. You're gonna be bug squash.","Anakin: Hey, JarJar. Keep away from those energy binders. If your hand gets caught in the beam, it's gonna go numb for hours.","Jar-Jar: Sorry. Okay. My tongue is fat. My tongue... Wrench. Where is da wrench? Oh, dare it is. Hey. Uh-oh. Uh, Ani, I'm stuck. Ani...","C-3PO: You know, I find that JarJar creature to be a little odd.","Kitster: You don't even know if this thing's gonna run.","Anakin: It will.","Qui-Gon: I think it's time we found out. Here, use this power charge.","Anakin: Yes, sir!","Qui-Gon: Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.","Jar-Jar: My... My mouth. Ani, I'm stuck. Uh, hey. My tongue is fat. Ani!","C-3PO: You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.","Jar-Jar: Oh. Th... Thank you. Go.","Anakin: It's working! It's working!","Qui-Gon: Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.","Anakin: There's so many. Do they all have a system of planets?","Qui-Gon: Most of them.","Anakin: Has anyone been to 'em all?","Qui-Gon: Not likely.","Anakin: I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.","Shmi: Ani, bedtime!","Anakin: Ow!","Qui-Gon: There we are. Good as new.","Shmi: Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.","Anakin: What are you doing?","Qui-Gon: Checking your blood for infections. Go on. You have a big day tomorrow. Sleep well, Ani.","Qui-Gon: Obi-Wan?","Obi-Wan: Yes, Master?","Qui-Gon: I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.","Obi-Wan: Wait a minute.","Qui-Gon: I need a midi-chlorian count.","Obi-Wan: The reading is off the chart. Over 20,000. Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high.","Qui-Gon: No Jedi has.","Obi-Wan: What does that mean?","Qui-Gon: I'm not sure.","Watto: I wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over.","Qui-Gon: Patience, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set. And we'll be far away from here.","Watto: Not if your ship belongs to me, I think, huh? I warn you, no funny business.","Qui-Gon: You don't think Anakin can win?","Watto: Don't get me wrong, no. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race, but, uh, Sebulba there is going to win, I think.","Jar-Jar: Oh, no!","Qui-Gon: Why do you think that?","Watto: He always wins! I am betting heavily on Sebulba.","Qui-Gon: I'll take that bet.","Watto: You what?","Qui-Gon: I'll wager my new racing pod against, say, the boy and his mother.","Watto: No pod is worth two slaves, not by a long shot.","Qui-Gon: The boy, then.","Watto: Hmm. Well, uh... We'll let fate decide, huh? I just happen to have a chance cube here. Blue, it's the boy. Red, uh... his mother.","Watto: You won this small toss, outlander, but you won't win the race! So it makes little difference!","Watto: Better stop your friend's betting, or I'll end up owning him too.","Anakin: What'd he mean by that?","Qui-Gon: I'll tell you later. Good morning.","C-3PO: Oh, my. Space travel sounds rather perilous.","C-3PO: I can assure you, they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships.","Kitster: This is so wizard, Ani. I'm sure you'll do it this time.","Padme: Do what?","Kitster: Finish the race, of course.","Padme: You've never won a race?","Anakin: Well, not exactly.","Padme: Not even finished?","Anakin: Kitster's right. I will this time.","Qui-Gon: Of course you will.","Fodesinbeed Annodue (Beed): Toogi! Toogie!

You won't walk away from this one, you slave scum.","Anakin: Don't count on it, slime ball.","Sebulba: You're bantha fodder!","Qui-Gon: You all set, Ani?","Anakin: Yep.","Qui-Gon: Right.","Anakin: Whoa!","Qui-Gon: Remember, concentrate on the moment.

I'm so very proud of you.","Anakin: Aww.","Watto: Oy chuba no. You. You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to do it. Somehow you knew it. I lost everything.","Qui-Gon: Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose. Bring the parts to the main hangar. I'll come by your shop later on so you can release the boy.","Watto: You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.","Qui-Gon: Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts? I'm sure they can settle this.","Watto: Take him.","Jar-Jar: Hidoe!","Qui-Gon: Well, we have all the essential parts we need. I'm going back. Some unfinished business. I won't be long.","Obi-Wan: Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life-form?","Qui-Gon: It's the boy who's responsible for getting us these parts. Get this hyperdrive generator installed.","Obi-Wan: Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long. Come on. Hup!","Qui-Gon: Hey. These are yours.","Anakin: Yes! Mom, we sold the pod! Look at all the money we have!","Shmi: My goodness! But that's so wonderful, Ani.","Qui-Gon: And he has been freed.","Anakin: What?","Qui-Gon: You're no longer a slave.","Anakin: Did you hear that?","Shmi: Now you can make your dreams come true, Ani. You are free. Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?","Qui-Gon: Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.","Anakin: You mean I get to come with you in your starship?","Qui-Gon: Anakin, training to become a Jedi is not an easy challenge, and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.","Anakin: But I wanna go. It's what I've always dreamed of doing. Can I go, Mom?","Shmi: Anakin, this path has been placed before you. The choice is yours alone.","Anakin: I wanna do it.","Qui-Gon: Then pack your things. We haven't much time.","Anakin: Yippee!","Anakin: What about Mom? Is she free too?","Qui-Gon: I tried to free your mother, Ani, but Watto wouldn't have it.","Anakin: You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?","Shmi: Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go.","Anakin: I don't want things to change.","Shmi: But you can't stop the change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Oh, I love you. Now, hurry.","Shmi: Thank you.","Qui-Gon: I'll watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?","Shmi: Yeah.","C-3PO: Oh! Oh, my. Oh! Hello, Master Anakin.","Anakin: Well, 3PO, I've been freed and I'm going away in a starship.","C-3PO: Master Anakin, you are my maker and I wish you well. However, I should prefer it if I were a little more completed.","Anakin: I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, giving you coverings and all. I'm gonna miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything.","C-3PO: Sell me?","Anakin: Bye.","C-3PO: Oh, my.","Anakin: I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.","Shmi: Ani.","Anakin: Will I ever see you again?","Shmi: What does your heart tell you?","Anakin: I hope so. Yes. I guess.","Shmi: Then we will see each other again.","Anakin: I will come back and free you, Mom. I promise.","Shmi: Now, be brave, and don't look back. Don't look back.","Anakin: Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!","Qui-Gon: Anakin! Drop! Go! Tell them to take off!","Captain Panaka: Qui-Gon's in trouble.","Obi-Wan: Take off. Over there. Fly low.","Anakin: Are you all right?","Qui-Gon: I think so.","Obi-Wan: What was it?","Qui-Gon: I'm not sure, but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is it was after the queen.","Anakin: What are we gonna do about it?","Qui-Gon: We shall be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Anakin: Hi. You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.","Nute Gunray: Your queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.","Sio Bibble: This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided.","Nute Gunray: Take him away.","B1 Battle Droid Captain: My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumoured underwater villages. They will not stay hidden for long.","Sio Bibble: The death toll is catastrophic. We must bow to their wishes. You must contact me.","Padme: You all right?","Anakin: It's very cold.","Padme: You come from a warm planet, Ani. A little too warm for my taste. Space is cold.","Anakin: You seem sad.","Padme: The queen is worried. Her people are suffering, dying. She must convince the senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what'll happen.","Anakin: I made this for you, so you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet. It'll bring you good fortune.","Padme: It's beautiful. But I don't need this to remember you by. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani, but my caring for you will remain.","Anakin: I care for you, too, only I...","Padme: Miss your mother.","Ric Olie: Coruscant. The entire planet is one big city. There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle. And look over there. Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.","Palpatine: It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. With the communications breakdown, we've been very concerned.","Palpatine: I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation.","Palpatine: May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.","Chancelor Valorum: Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honour to finally meet you in person.","Sabe: Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.","Chancelor Valorum: I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the current situation. I've called for a special session of the senate to hear your position.","Sabe: I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.","Palpatine: There is a question of procedure, but I'm confident we can overcome it.","Qui-Gon: I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately. The situation has become much more complicated.","Padme: Ani, come on.","Jar-Jar: The queen's a bein' grossly nice, mesa tinks. Pitty hot.","Palpatine: There is no civility, only politics. The Republic is not what it once was. The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.","Palpatine: There is no interest in the common good. I must be frank, Your Majesty. There is little chance the senate will act on the invasion.","Padme: Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.","Palpatine: If I may say so, Your Majesty, the chancellor has little real power. He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. The bureaucrats are in charge now.","Padme: What options have we?","Palpatine: Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor, one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice.","Palpatine: You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.","Padme: He has been our strongest supporter.","Palpatine: Our only other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.","Padme: The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate. Our people are dying, Senator. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.","Palpatine: To be realistic, Your Majesty, I think we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.","Padme: That is something I cannot do.","Qui-Gon: He was trained in the Jedi arts. My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Impossible. The Sith have been extinct for a millennium.","Mace Windu: I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing.","Yoda: Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.","Mace Windu: We will use all our resources to unravel this mystery. We will discover the identity of your attacker. May the Force be with you.","Yoda: Master Qui-Gon. More to say have you?","Qui-Gon: With your permission, my master, I have encountered a vergence in the Force.","Yoda: A vergence, you say?","Mace Windu: Located around a person?","Qui-Gon: A boy. His cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.","Mace Windu: You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the Force. You believe it's this boy?","Qui-Gon: I don't presume to...","Yoda: But you do. Revealed your opinion is.","Qui-Gon: I request the boy be tested, Master.","Yoda: Oh? Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?","Qui-Gon: Finding him was the will of the Force. I have no doubt of that.","Mace Windu: Bring him before us, then.","Nubian Guard: The boy's here to see Padm\xe9.","Corde: Let him in. I'm sorry, Ani, but Padm\xe9's not here right now.","Padme: Who is it?","Corde: Anakin Skywalker to see Padm\xe9, Your Highness.","Padme: I've sent Padm\xe9 on an errand.","Anakin: I'm on my way to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope. I may never see her again, so I came to say good-bye.","Padme: We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.","Anakin: Thank you, Your Highness.","Chancelor Valorum: The chair recognizes the senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.","Palpatine: Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the senate, a tragedy has occurred which started right here with the taxation of trade routes and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation.","Lott Dod: This is outrageous! I object to the senator's statements.","Chancelor Valorum: The chair does not recognize the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.","Palpatine: To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, recently elected ruler of the Naboo, who speaks on our behalf.","Padme: Honourable representatives of the Republic, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade...","Lott Dod: I object! There is no proof! This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.","Aks Moe: The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honourable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed.","Chancelor Valorum: The point...","Mas Amedda: Excuse me, Chancellor.","Palpatine: Enter the bureaucrat. The true rulers of the Republic. And on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.","Chancelor Valorum: The point is conceded. Will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?","Padme: I will not defer. I've come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now.","Padme: I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed.","Padme: I move for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.","Congress: Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!","Mas Amedda: Order!","Palpatine: Now they will elect a new chancellor, a strong chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue.","Obi-Wan: The boy will not pass the council's test, Master. He's too old.","Qui-Gon: Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.","Obi-Wan: Do not defy the council, Master, not again.","Qui-Gon: I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.","Obi-Wan: If you would just follow the code, you would be on the council. They will not go along with you this time.","Qui-Gon: You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.","Anakin: A ship. A cup. A ship. A speeder.","Yoda: Hmm. How feel you?","Anakin: Cold, sir.","Yoda: Afraid are you?","Anakin: No, sir.","Yoda: See through you we can.","Mace Windu: Be mindful of your feelings.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Your thoughts dwell on your mother.","Anakin: I miss her.","Yoda: Mmm. Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?","Anakin: What has that got to do with anything?","Yoda: Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.","Jar-Jar: Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die?","Padme: I don't know.","Jar-Jar: Gungans get pasted too, eh?","Padme: I hope not.","Jar-Jar: Gungans no dyin' without a fight. Wesa warriors. Wesa got a grand army. Dat's why you no liken us, mesa tinks.","Captain Panaka: Your Highness? Your Highness. Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as supreme chancellor.","Palpatine: A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.","Palpatine: Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption.","Padme: Who else has been nominated?","Captain Panaka: Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.","Palpatine: I feel confident our situation will create a strong sympathy vote for us. I will be chancellor.","Padme: I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, senator, there'll be nothing left of our people, our way of life.","Palpatine: I understand your concern, Your Majesty. Unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet.","Padme: Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I've decided to go back to Naboo.","Palpatine: Go back? But, Your Majesty, be realistic. They'll force you to sign the treaty.","Padme: I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different than that of our people. Captain.","Captain Panaka: Your Highness.","Padme: Ready my ship.","Palpatine: Please, Your Majesty, stay here where it's safe.","Padme: It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: The Force is strong with him.","Qui-Gon: He is to be trained, then?","Mace Windu: No, he will not be trained.","Qui-Gon: No?","Mace Windu: He is too old.","Qui-Gon: He is the chosen one. You must see it.","Yoda: Mmm. Clouded this boy's future is.","Qui-Gon: I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.","Yoda: An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible to take on a second.","Mace Windu: The code forbids it.","Qui-Gon: Obi-Wan is ready.","Obi-Wan: I am ready to face the trials.","Yoda: Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready.","Qui-Gon: He is headstrong, and he has much to learn of the living Force, but he is capable. There is little more he can learn from me.","Yoda: Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later. Now is not the time for this.","Mace Windu: The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor, and Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation and could widen the confrontation.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: And draw out the queen's attacker.","Mace Windu: Go with the queen to Naboo and discover the identity of this dark warrior. This is the clue we need to unravel the mystery of the Sith.","Yoda: May the Force be with you.","Obi-Wan: It's not disrespect, Master. It's the truth.","Qui-Gon: From your point of view.","Obi-Wan: The boy is dangerous. They all sense it. Why can't you?","Qui-Gon: His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.","Qui-Gon: The council will decide Anakin's future. That should be enough for you. Now get on board.","Anakin: Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.","Qui-Gon: You won't be, Ani. I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful.","Qui-Gon: Always remember: Your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you'll be safe.","Anakin: Master, sir, I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians. I've been wondering... What are midi-chlorians?","Qui-Gon: Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form that resides within all living cells.","Anakin: They live inside me?","Qui-Gon: Inside your cells, yes. And we are symbionts with them.","Anakin: Symbionts?","Qui-Gon: Life-forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist and we would have no knowledge of the Force.","Qui-Gon: They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind, you'll hear them speaking to you.","Anakin: I don't understand.","Qui-Gon: With time and training, Ani, you will. You will.","Qui-Gon: Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.","Padme: I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears that the Federation means to destroy me.","Qui-Gon: I assure you I will not allow that to happen.","Jar-Jar: Wesa goin' home!","Anakin: Come on, R2.","Palpatine: Is the planet secure?","Nute Gunray: We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life-forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.","Palpatine: Good. I will see to it that in the senate things stay as they are.","Palpatine: I am sending my apprentice, Darth Maul, to join you.","Nute Gunray: Yes, my lord.","Rune Haako: A Sith here?","Ric Olie: Those are the forward stabilizers.","Anakin: And those two control the pitch?","Ric Olie: You catch on pretty quick.","Captain Panaka: As soon as we land, the Federation will arrest you and force you to sign the treaty.","Qui-Gon: I agree. I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this.","Padme: I will take back what's ours.","Captain Panaka: There are too few of us, Your Highness. We have no army.","Qui-Gon: And I can only protect you. I can't fight a war for you.","Padme: JarJar Binks.","Jar-Jar: Mesa, Your Highness?","Padme: Yes. I need your help.","Ric Olie: I have one battleship on my scope.","Obi-Wan: It's a droid control ship.","Captain Panaka: They've probably spotted us.","Obi-Wan: We haven't much time.","Obi-Wan: JarJar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.","Qui-Gon: Good.","Obi-Wan: Do you think the queen's idea will work?","Qui-Gon: The Gungans will not be easily swayed. And we cannot use our power to help her.","Obi-Wan: I'm... I'm sorry for my behaviour, Master. It's not my place to disagree with you about the boy. And I am grateful you think I'm ready to take the trials.","memery2Hype You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan. And you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi knight.","Jar-Jar: Desa nobody dare. The Gungan city is deserted. Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.","Obi-Wan: Do you think they have been taken to the camps?","Captain Panaka: More likely they were wiped out.","Jar-Jar: Mesa no tink so.","Qui-Gon: Do you know where they are, JarJar?","Jar-Jar: When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place. Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!","Captain Tarpals: Your Honour, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.","Jar-Jar: Uh, h-hello dadee, Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.","Boss Nass: JarJar Binks. Who's da uss-en uthers?","Sabe: I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo. I come before you in peace.","Boss Nass: Ah, Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks. Yousa all bombad.","Sabe: We have searched you out because we wish to form an alliance.","Padme: Your Honour.","Boss Nass: Whosa dis?","Padme: I am Queen Amidala.","Jar-Jar: Huh?","Padme: This is my decoy, my protection, my loyal bodyguard. I'm sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to protect myself.","Padme: Although we do not always agree, Your Honour, our two great societies have always lived in peace.","Boss Nass: Ah.","Padme: The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever.","Padme: I ask you to help us. No, I beg you to help us. We are your humble servants. Our fate is in your hands.","Boss Nass: Ha! Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans? Meeesa lika dis! Maybe... wesa... being friends.","Jar-Jar: Yippee! Ya-hoo!","Nute Gunray: We've sent our patrols. We already located their starship in the swamp. It won't be long, my lord.","Palpatine: This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggressive.","Palpatine: Lord Maul, be mindful. Let them make the first move.","Darth Maul: Yes, my master.","Gungan Guard: Deysa comin!","Anakin: All right! They're here!","Padme: Good. They made it.","Boss Nass: Yousa doen grand. JarJar bring uss-en and da Naboo together.","Jar-Jar: Ah, no, no, no.","Boss Nass: So, wesa make you bombad general.","Jar-Jar: General?","Qui-Gon: Captain.","Captain Panaka: Your Highness.","Padme: What is the situation?","Captain Panaka: Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground resistance movement. I brought back as many of the leaders as I could.","Captain Panaka: The Federation army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger.","Captain Panaka: Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think that we can win.","Padme: The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the droid army away from the cities. R2.","Padme: We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka will create a diversion.","Padme: Then we can enter the palace and capture the viceroy. Without the viceroy, they will be lost and confused. What do you think, Master Jedi?","Qui-Gon: The viceroy will be well-guarded.","Captain Panaka: The difficulty is getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.","Qui-Gon: There is a possibility, with this diversion, many Gungans will be killed.","Boss Nass: Wesa ready to do our-san part.","Padme: We have a plan which should immobilize the droid army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the droid control ship orbiting the planet.","Qui-Gon: A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields. There's an even bigger danger.","Obi-Wan: If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.","Padme: Well, that is why we must not fail to get the viceroy. Everything depends on it.","Palpatine: She is more foolish than I thought.","Nute Gunray: We are sending all troops to meet this army assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives.","Palpatine: This will work to our advantage.","Nute Gunray: I have your approval to proceed, then, my lord?","Palpatine: Wipe them out. All of them.","Captain Tarpals: Halt! Starting up the shield.","B1 Battle Droid Captain: Open fire.","Qui-Gon: Once we get inside, you find a safe place to hide and stay there.","Anakin: Sure.","Qui-Gon: Stay there.","B1 Battle Droid: Roger. Roger.","Nute Gunray: I thought the battle was going to take place far from here. This is too close.","Qui-Gon: Ani, find cover. Quick!","Padme: Get to your ships!","Ric Olie: Fighters straight ahead.","Bravo Three: Roger, Bravo Leader.","Bravo Five: Roger, Bravo Leader.","B1 Battle Droid Captain: Cease fire.","Jar-Jar: Steady. Steady.","Rune Haako: Activate the droids.","Tey How: Yes, sir.","Captain Tarpals: Ouch time.","Captain Tarpals: Fire!","Padme: My guess is the viceroy's in the throne room.","Captain Panaka: Red group! Blue group! Everybody, this way!","Anakin: Hey, wait for me!","Qui-Gon: Anakin, stay where you are. You'll be safe there.","Anakin: But I...","Qui-Gon: Stay in that cockpit.","Qui-Gon: We'll handle this.","Padme: We'll take the long way.","Anakin: We gotta do something, R2. I'm trying to! I don't know where the trigger is!","Anakin: Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one. Nope. Wait. Here it is.","Anakin: Yeah! Let's go! It's on automatic pilot. Try to override it.","Padme: We don't have time for this, Captain.","Anakin: Look! There they are. That's where the autopilot's taking us.","Jar-Jar: Dumb droid. Take that! Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off! Ooh! Ooh! Mooie!","Ric Olie: The deflector shield is too strong.","Anakin: This is tense! Whoa! R2, get us off this autopilot. It's gonna get us both killed.","Anakin: You did it, R2! Okay, let's go left. Go back? Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, so that's what I'm gonna do.","Anakin: I'll try spinning. That's a good trick. Whoa!","Anakin: I know we're in trouble. Just hang on.","Captain Panaka: Go! Ascension guns!","Jar-Jar: Retreat! Retreat!","Jar-Jar: Dis is nutsen.","Jar-Jar: Hyah! Uh-oh. Big boomers.","Jar-Jar: Hey! Hey! Give me a lift!","Captain Tarpals: JarJar, usen da booma!","Jar-Jar: What? Mesa no have a booma!","Captain Tarpals: Here. Taken dis one.","Jar-Jar: Help me!","Captain Tarpals: JarJar! Jump, JarJar, jump!","Padme: Put down your weapons. They win this round.","Anakin: We're hit, R2! I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!","Anakin: Everything's overheated. Oops. This is not good.","Obi-Wan: No!","Captain Tarpals: No giben up, General JarJar. Mesa tink of something.","B1 Battle Droid: Hands up.","Jar-Jar: My give up. My give up.","Nute Gunray: Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty and end this pointless debate in the senate.","Sabe: Viceroy! Your occupation here has ended.","Nute Gunray: After her. This one's a decoy.","Padme: Captain!","Captain Panaka: Jam the doors.","Padme: Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty.","Anakin: Yes! We have power. Shields up.","Anakin: Take this! And this! Whoa! Oops.","Tey How: We're losing power. There seems to be a problem with the main reactor.","Rune Haako: Impossible! Nothing can get through our shield.","Anakin: Let's get outta here.","Bravo Five: What's that? It's blowing up from the inside!","Ric Olie: We didn't hit it.","Anakin: Now, this is Podracing.","Bravo Three: Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!","Anakin: Whoo! Whoo!","Bravo Three: Yeah!","Bravo Two: Hee-hee!","Jar-Jar: What the...Was'n they doing?","Captain Tarpals: The control ship has been destroyed. Look!","Jar-Jar: They all broke-ed.","Qui-Gon: No, it... it's too late. It's...","Obi-Wan: No.","Qui-Gon: Obi-Wan. Promise... Promise me you will train the boy.","Obi-Wan: Yes, Master.","Qui-Gon: He is the chosen one. He... will bring balance. Train him.","Padme: Now, Viceroy, you're going to have to go back to the senate and explain all this.","Captain Panaka: I think you can kiss your trade franchise good-bye.","Palpatine: We are indebted to you for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Palpatine: And you, young Skywalker. We will watch your career with great interest.","Padme: Congratulations on your election, Chancellor.","Palpatine: Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It's you who should be congratulated.","Palpatine: Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic.","Yoda: Confer on you the level of Jedi knight the council does. But agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner I do not.","Obi-Wan: Qui-Gon believed in him.","Yoda: The chosen one the boy may be. Nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.","Obi-Wan: Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the council, if I must.","Yoda: Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that you do not.","Yoda: Agree with you the council does. Your apprentice Skywalker will be.","Anakin: What will happen to me now?","Obi-Wan: The council have granted me permission to train you. You will be a Jedi, I promise.","Mace Windu: There's no doubt the mysterious warrior was a Sith.","Yoda: Mmm. Always two there are. No more, no less.

Senator Amidala of the Naboo system'has been assassinated. ","There is a shocked silence in the vast arena. ","PALPATINE: This' grievous blow'is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice ' not only here in this honorable assembly, but also on her home planet. (sad beat, then continues) She was so loved, the people would have gladly elected her Queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom' and as a dear friend. ","A moment of silence. Then three-eyed Senator ASK AAK of the Congress of Malastare raises his floating podium into view before Chancellor Palpatine's podium. ","ASK AAK: How many more senators will die before this civil strife ends?!? We must confront these rebels now, and we need an army to do it!!","A second pod comes into view. Inside it is DARSANA, Ambassador of Glee Anselm. ","DARSANA: Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination?? We are no longer safe under their protection!!","Senator ORN FREE TAA floats into view next. ","ORN FREE TAA: The Republic needs more security NOW ' before it comes to war!!

","The crowd erupts in a fury. Dissenting opinions fill the air, and Mas Amedda tries to calm things down. Suddenly, to Palpatine's and the Senate's surprise, Senator Amidala (with Captain Typho, a well-dressed JAR JAR BINKS and the handmaiden DORME in tow) comes forward in her pod!! ","PADME: My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war!! ","A shocked beat of silence. Then the Senate fills with wild cheering and applause. Palpatine is stunned, but quickly recovers. ","PALPATINE: I-it is with great surprise and joy the chair recognizes the Senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala. ","PADME: Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. (lets that sink in) I was the target. But more importantly, I believe this security measure before you was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army'but there is somebody in this body who will stop at nothing to assure its' passage'","Several Senators leap out of their seats, booing Padme loudly. Others shake their heads in confusion ' is Padme accusing one of them of attempted murder?!?","PADME: I warn you. If you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war firsthand ' I do not wish to do so again. ","The Senate is filled with jeers and boos. ","ORN FREE TAA: This is insanity, I say! I move that we defer this vote immediately! ","The Senators are now arguing and yelling at each other, both for and against her statements. Padme's iron temper slips. ","PADME: WAKE UP, SENATORS!!!","The Senate is stunned into silence. ","PADME: You must wake up!! If we offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives, ALL will lose their freedom! This decision could well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic! I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. VOTE DOWN this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here WANT that?? I cannot believe they do'","There is an undercurrent of boos and groans from the Senators. Orn Free Taa moves his pod next to Padme's. ","ORN FREE TAA: My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law. ","Padme stares daggers at the obese Twi'lek senator. Palpatine looks at her with a mixture of pity and weariness. ","PALPATINE: In view of the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands adjourned. ","On Padme's pod, a small viewscreen comes up, saying that the Chancellor wants to meet with her in private. ","EXT.

","PADME: I don't wish to disagree'but I think that Count Dooku was behind it. ","The assembled group looks at each other in surprise. Mace Windu is most disturbed of all.

APARTMENT BUILDING ELEVATOR ' LATE DAY","In a moving windowed elevator attached to the outside of the Senate Building, two Jedi wait. They are OBI-WAN KENOBI and ANAKIN SKYWALKER. Obi-Wan is now thirty-five, with long hair and a graying beard. He strongly resembles the late Qui-Gon Jinn now, in more ways than one. Anakin, meanwhile, is virtually unrecognizable. The nineteen-year-old towers over Obi-Wan, and is lanky and handsome. While he wears his hair in the manner of a Padawan Learner (short and spiky with a long braid), his uniform is darker and more stylish than the usual apprentice. Obi-Wan waits patiently as the elevator climbs; Anakin squirms and nervously rearranges his robes. ","OBI-WAN: You seem a little on edge. ","ANAKIN: Not at all. ","OBI-WAN: I haven't felt you this tense since'since we fell into that nest of gundarks. ","ANAKIN: You fell into that nightmare, Master, and I rescued you. Remember? ","OBI-WAN: (beat) Oh...yes.

And you will pay attention to my lead.","ANAKIN: Why?","OBI-WAN: (sharply) What??!!","Jar Jar gulps.","ANAKIN: Why else do you think we were assigned to protect her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.","OBI-WAN: We will do exactly as the Council has instructed. (beat) And you will learn your place, young one.","Anakin lowers his head. Padme and Typho have been watching this scene sympathetically. Now Padme gets up. ","PADME: Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now, if you will excuse me, I will retire.","Everyone else gets up. Obi-Wan gives Amidala a slight bow as she and Dorme leave the room.","TYPHO: Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here. ","ANAKIN: What have you learned? ","Obi-Wan throws Anakin a warning look. ","TYPHO: Not much. She's very determined to deal with the separatists through negotiation and not force.

Obi-Wan realizes the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The droid's systems light up again, and it takes off. The droid bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takes the Jedi wildly between buildings and finally skims a rooftop as Obi-Wan is forced to lift his legs, then run across the roof, tenaciously hanging on to the droid.  ","EXT.

","ANAKIN: I thought I already did. ","OBI-WAN: Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.","As this conversation is going on, Anakin deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic. Zam then flies her speeder sharply downward. Anakin steers his speeder down after her. The two speeders plunge straight down through moving lanes of air traffic. She finally levels off near a huge building; Anakin keeps shooting straight down, straight towards the roof. Obi-Wan tenses up as the building looms ever closer. ","OBI-WAN: Pull up, Anakin' PULL UP!!","Laughing, Anakin finally pulls up just before he can smash into the building. The speeder misses the roof by inches.

They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. Zam weaves around flaming smokestacks at very close range, trying to set her pursuers on fire. ","The chase heads for a power refinery. Pulling out her laser pistol, Zam shoots a power coupler causing voltage, like lightning, to jump across a gap from one coupler to another. But Anakin stays on course, piloting the speeder directly through the arc. Anakin and Obi-Wan's bodies ripple with blue power. Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass. ","OBI-WAN: Anakin, how many times have I told you to stay away from power couplings?!? ","The speeders finally fly out of the lightning. ","OBI-WAN: (sarcastic) Oh, that was good'","ANAKIN: That was crazy!!!","The Jedi tear after Zam. Zam goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. Zam turns down and left, into a transit tunnel built into a huge building. Anakin pulls up and to the right. ","OBI-WAN: Where are you going?!? He went that way!!  ","ANAKIN: Master, if we keep this chase going any longer, that creep is gonna end up deep fried! And personally, I'd very much like to find out who he is and who he's working for!! This is a shortcut'I think.  ","OBI-WAN: What do you mean, 'You think?'","Zam's speeder shoots out of the other end of the transit tunnel. Anakin's speeder is nowhere in sight. Zam removes the veil from her face, smirking in satisfaction. ","Anakin turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways. He comes to a stop, hovering about fifty stories up. Obi-Wan folds his arms and looks disapprovingly at the searching Anakin. ","OBI-WAN: Well, you've lost him. ","ANAKIN: (he doesn't mean it) I'm deeply sorry, Master.","Anakin looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.","OBI-WAN: That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. Once again, you've proved --","ANAKIN: If you'll excuse me? ","Suddenly Anakin jumps out of the speeder!! Obi-Wan looks down and sees Zam's speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ","OBI-WAN: I hate it when he does that. ","Anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunter's speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. Zam looks up and realizes what has happened. Suddenly, Zam just stops, and Anakin flies forward to the left front fork. Zam shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a blast near Anakin's hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. Anakin slides to the right fork of the speeder, where Zam can't reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop. Zam takes off, and Anakin slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but he manages to hang on. He works his way back to the speeder's cockpit. Zam briefly changes back into her gray reptilian Clawdite form and sneers at him.","Obi-Wan has jumped into the driver's seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Soon Anakin is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. Zam takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless Jedi, knocking the sword out of Anakin's hand. Obi-Wan races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger's seat. ","Anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and grabs the gun in Zam's hand. They struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing the dashboard and speeder controls to bits. The speeder careens wildly out of control. Zam struggles to pull the speeder out of its' nosedive. Obi-Wan gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunter's speeder.

Anakin moves to give chase into the very crowded street. ","It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected in filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various alien lowlifes, panhandling droids, and the occasional group of upper-class slummers. Anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing Zam. He loses the bounty hunter in the crowd, then sees her again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd. Obi-Wan lands the speeder in the nearby street. He gets out and runs through the crowd toward Anakin.","Ahead, Zam turns in through a door and disappears. A nightclub sign is flashing over the door.

","ANAKIN: I doubt if Naboo has changed much either. ","PADME: It hasn't ' ","ANAKIN: (stepping over her words) I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualize the Force, those hills are what I see. (pause) I love Naboo. ","Another awkward moment. Anakin's words say he loves Naboo, but his intent stare at Padme says something else entirely. Padme again tries to change the topic. ","PADME: You were dreaming about your mother earlier, weren't you? ","ANAKIN: (quiet) Yes. It's true. (looks down) I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it.

JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY ' DAY","Obi-Wan walks through the main hallway of the Jedi Temple to the training area. ","INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA -- DAY","Obi-Wan comes out onto the veranda and stops. He watches twenty or so four year olds of various races doing training exercises, supervised by Jedi Master Yoda. The younglings wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little training droids with their miniature lightsabers. The droids dance in front of them. ","YODA: Reach out and sense the Force around you. Use your feelings, you must. ","Yoda notices Obi-Wan and taps the ground with his cane. ","YODA: Younglings ' Younglings, enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.","The children take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers. The training droids float up to the ceiling, out of sight. ","YODA: Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.","CHILDREN: Hello, Master Obi-Wan!","OBI-WAN: Hello. (to Yoda) I am sorry to disturb you, Master.","YODA: What help can I be, Obi-Wan? Hmm? ","OBI-WAN: I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the systems don't show in the archive maps.","YODA: Hmm. Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing, how embarrassing...","One of the children smothers a giggle. ","YODA: Liam, the shades. An interesting puzzle' ","One of the children, LIAM, closes the shades. ","YODA: Gather around the map reader. Clear your minds, and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will. Bobby, the lights please'","BOBBY turns off the lights, casting the room into darkness. Yoda gathers the younglings around the map reader. The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The children gather around it. Obi-Wan takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The children laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. Obi-Wan walks into the display. ","OBI-WAN: (pointing) It ought to be'here' but it isn't. Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot. ","YODA: Most interesting' Gravity's silhouette remains, but the star and all the planets'disappeared, they have. How can this be?","Yoda turns to the class. ","YODA: Now younglings'in your mind, what is the first thing you see? An answer, hmm? A thought? Anyone? ","There is a brief pause. Then a child puts its hand up. Yoda nods.","JK BURTOLA: Master? Because someone erased it from the archive memory.","CHILDREN: That's right! Yes! That's what happened! Someone erased it!","MARI AMITHEST: (another of the children) If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.","YODA: (chuckles) Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. The Padawan is right ' go to the center of gravity's pull, and find your planet you will.","Yoda and Obi-Wan move away from the children. With a hand movement, Obi-Wan causes the star map to disappear. He uses the Force to call the glass ball back to his hand as the two walk into an adjoining room. ","YODA: Hmm'the data must have been erased. ","OBI-WAN: But Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives? That's impossible, isn't it?","YODA: (frowns) Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is. Only a Jedi could have erased those files. But who and why'harder to answer. Meditate on this, I will. May the Force be with you. ","Obi-Wan bows and walks off as Yoda walks back toward the children.","EXT. ANOTHER LANDING PLATFORM ' DAY","Obi-Wan's red-and-white Delta-7 starfighter is ready for takeoff. Obi-Wan and Mace Windu stand beside it.","MACE WINDU: Be wary, the disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.","Obi-Wan nods'then sighs with worry. ","OBI-WAN: Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator.","MACE WINDU: Why?","OBI-WAN: He has a' an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was a boy. Now he is confused, distracted...","MACE WINDU: Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path.","Obi-Wan then climbs into the cockpit of his starfighter. Mace smiles and waves.

NABOO SPACEPORT  ' DAY","The starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed. Among the departing passengers are Anakin and Padme (dressed as peasants) and Artoo. They head over to the main plaza where they board a speeder bus. ","EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD -- AFTERNOON","The speeder bus pulls up and stops at the Grand Courtyard of Theed, and Anakin, Padme and Artoo get out. Anakin stares out at the wide, beautiful courtyard in wonder. The great courtyard stretches before them, and they see the rose-colored domes of the palace on the far side. Artoo whistles. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. Artoo trundles behind them. ","ANAKIN: If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave. ","PADME: (laughs) I doubt that. ","ANAKIN: No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about' (beat) The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace. The way it shimmers in the sunlight. The way the air always smells of flowers'","PADME: (wistful) 'and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the capitol, I was very young. I'd never seen a waterfall before. I thought they were so beautiful'I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace. ","ANAKIN: Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?","PADME: (laughing) No! That was the last thing I thought of. But the more history I studied, the more I realized how much good politicians could do. After school I became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that before I knew it I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. (beat) I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.","ANAKIN: The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they even tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.","Padme frowns at this. ","PADME: Popular rule is not democracy, Ani. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up.","She looks down at the ground in contemplation. ","PADME: So were my parents. They worried about me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now' (grins at Anakin) My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids' but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.","ANAKIN: I agree with her! I think the Republic needs you' I'm glad that you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.","PADME: I think so too.","Anakin and Padme walk toward the palace. Artoo continues to follow.

I only wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote. ","SIO BIBBLE: Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has explained it all. Given the circumstances, Senator, returning home was the only real choice you could have made. ","Padme gives Bibble a resigned nod. ","QUEEN JAMILLIA: How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?","PADME: Thousands. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war. ","Both Jamillia and Sio are shaken by this. ","SIO BIBBLE: It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!","QUEEN JAMILLIA: Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?","PADME: Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Trade Federation or the Commerce Guilds for help.","QUEEN JAMILLIA: The armies of commerce! Why has nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?!? ","PADME: I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds. ","SIO BIBBLE: It's outrageous that after all of those hearings and four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation. I fear the Senate is powerless to resolve this crisis. Do those money mongers control everything?","QUEEN JAMILLIA: Remember, Counselor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. (beat) That's a move in the right direction.","PADME: (winces) There are rumors, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.","ANAKIN: The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It was' considered to be too dangerous for the economy.","QUEEN JAMILLIA: (smiles) We must keep our faith in the Republic. ","The Queen rises from her throne, and everyone else rises with her.

(To Jamillia) But I was thinking ' ","ANAKIN: Hey, hold on a minute'","PADME: (stern look at Anakin) Excuse me! (back to Jamillia) I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. ","ANAKIN: Excuse me! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady!!","The tension between the two fills the room. Bibble and Jamillia look at each other with worry. ","PADME: Ani, my life is at risk. And this is my home. I know it very well, that is why we're here. I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance. ","Anakin takes a deep breath and forces a polite smile, though his eyes still blaze with anger. ","ANAKIN: Sorry, M'Lady. ","SIO BIBBLE: (half amused) She's right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people, and a clear view of the surrounding terrain. ","QUEEN JAMILLIA: Perfect. It's settled then. Padme, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave ' your family's very worried about you'","PADME: Thank you, your Highness.

We are a very fortunate people, and we know it. That good fortune shouldn't be taken for granted, so we try to share and try to help. In doing so, we become something larger than ourselves, and more fulfilled than one can become from idly enjoying good fortune. ","ANAKIN: It's the same with the Jedi, I suppose. We've been given great gifts, and we train hard to make the most of them. And then we use our powers to try to help the galaxy, to make everything a little bit better.

","OBI-WAN: I see. ","LAMA SU: You'll find they are totally obedient, taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. ","The trio continue to walk down the glass tunnel. ","OBI-WAN: And who was the original host?","LAMA SU: A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sifo-Dyas handpicked Jango Fett himself.","Obi-Wan notes the words 'bounty hunter,' but keeps his expression neutral. ","OBI-WAN: And where is this bounty hunter now?","LAMA SU: Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.","The tour continues through a long corridor filled with narrow, transparent tubes into which clones are climbing. Once in the tube, the clone goes to sleep. The other side of the tunnel looks out upon a vast training area when clones of various ages go through rigorous martial arts matches.","OBI-WAN: Very disciplined. ","LAMA SU: That is the key. Disciplined, and yet able to think creatively. It is a mighty combination. Sifo-Dyas explained to us the Jedi aversion to leading droids. He told us Jedi could only command an army of life forms. ","OBI-WAN: So this Jango Fett willingly lives here? ","LAMA SU: The choice is his alone. Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious, isn't it?","OBI-WAN: Unaltered?","The tour now moves over a vast grouping of lines. Several hundred adult clones, now in white armor, move to a conveyor belt where white helmets are rolling along. Each clone takes a helmet, dons it, and moves out. ","LAMA SU: Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...","OBI-WAN: I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.","TAUN WE: I would be very happy to arrange it for you.","Finally the tunnel ends, and Obi-Wan, Lama Su and Taun We come out onto a balcony.

We've got to get to that hangar! Get a transport! HURRY!!","CLONE TROOPER: Right away!!","The two run toward the distant battlefield.","INT. GEONOSIS SECRET HANGAR TOWER ' LATE DAY","Dooku increases the tempo of his attack. Obi-Wan is pushed to the limit to defend himself. Dooku presses. Obi-Wan makes a lunging slash, and a laughing Dooku catches it. The two struggle in a test of strength, the two energy blades straining against each other. Dooku wins the test and runs his blade through Obi-Wan's shoulder. The younger Jedi screams in agony and drops his blade. Dooku then slices Obi-Wan's leg for good measure. Obi-Wan stumbles back against the wall, trips, and crashes to the ground. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor. ","COUNT DOOKU: And so it ends'","With a shrug, he raises his blade for the final blow as Obi-Wan stares at him helplessly ' ","-- and Anakin's blade blocks it in mid-swing!!","Dooku is shocked and takes a step back. He regards Anakin with incredulity. ","COUNT DOOKU: Brave of you, boy ' but I thought you'd learned your lesson.","ANAKIN: (sneers) I am a slow learner. ","Anakin begins a flurry of attacks on Dooku. The fury of his attack catches Dooku off-guard, and he staggers back. Anakin swings and nicks him, and Dooku gasps and clutches the side of his arm. He pulls his hand away and stares at his blood, then looks at Anakin with a new respect. ","COUNT DOOKU: You have unusual powers, my young Padawan. But not enough to save you this time. ","ANAKIN: Don't bet on it! ","OBI-WAN: ANAKIN!! ","Obi-Wan uses the Force to fling his lightsaber at Anakin. He catches it. Anakin skillfully wields the two lightsabers with relative ease. Dooku parries and ripostes. It's no contest. Dooku knocks Obi-Wan's green lightsaber from Anakin's hand and relentless drives Anakin back. Anakin retreats, slicing a power cable on the floor. The hangar is cast into darkness, except for the blue and scarlet lights of the lightsaber blades. Another fierce, lightning-fast clash of blades. With a roar, Anakin thrusts forward -- and Dooku cuts Anakin's sword arm off at the elbow. ","Before he even has the chance to scream, Dooku throws out his hand and Anakin is Force-shoved across the room. He falls and skids to a halt beside Obi-Wan's body, driven unconscious by the shock and pain. Dooku sighs and extinguishes his lightsaber, suddenly seeming much older. He looks up and turns at a tapping noise at the hangar door'","Slowly, through the thick smoke, the tiny figure of Yoda hobbles into view. He stops on the smoke-filled threshold.","YODA: Count Dooku. ","COUNT DOOKU: Master Yoda. ","Dooku steps away from Obi-Wan and Anakin. For the first time, a hint of fear enters Dooku's eyes. ","COUNT DOOKU: You have interfered in our affairs for the last time. Now we shall see who is the most powerful.  ","Dooku levitates machinery in the room and hurtles it at the tiny figure of the Jedi Master. Yoda effortlessly deflects the machinery and strikes a martial arts pose.","Dooku then causes great boulders in the ceiling above Yoda to fall. Again, Yoda deflects the boulders, which fall around him. ","YODA: Powerful you have become, Dooku. The Dark Side I sense in you. ","COUNT DOOKU: I've become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you.  ","Dooku thrusts out his arm, flinging out purple Force lightning. Yoda catches the lightning in his hand ' balls it up ' and hurtles it right back at him!! Dooku deflects it into the wall, but just barely. He shoots more lightning out. Yoda again catches it in his hand, and it absorbs into his palm. ","YODA: Much to learn you still have. ","COUNT DOOKU: It is obvious this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force'","Dooku reignites his lightsaber. ","COUNT DOOKU: 'but by our skills with a lightsaber. ","YODA: No interest in contests do I have. ","Dooku whirls his lightsaber in a formal salute. Yoda Force-pulls his lightsaber out from under his robe and ignites it. ","Yoda attacks! He flies forward with a screeching yell. Dooku is forced to retreat. Words are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. The little gnome's lightsaber is a blur of emerald-green light, too fast for Dooku to defend against. He smoothly blocks Dooku's blows and spins through the air like a tiny tornado, bouncing off the Sail Ship and the hangar wall. Finally, their blades cross and the fighting slows. Yoda inches closer and quietly speaks'","YODA: Fought well you have, my old Padawan. But the end for you this is. ","COUNT DOOKU: The battle is far from over. This is just the beginning -- ","Mustering all the strength he can find, Dooku suddenly dislodges Yoda and, using the Force, brings one of the huge hanging ceiling cranes in the hangar crashing down on Obi-Wan and Anakin. In the blink of an eye, Yoda closes his eyes and concentrates. The fallen crane trembles and starts to lift. Count Dooku runs up the ship's ramp, throwing a last look back before going inside. ","Obi-Wan is still awake and tries to add what little strength he has left into helping his old master. Yoda concentrates harder. Slowly, with their combined power, the crane rises. Yoda exerts every ounce of his powers. The crane lifts clear of Obi-Wan and Anakin and is thrown to the ground.","The Sail Ship's ramp closes, and the sound of the ship's engines are heard starting up.","EXT. GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE ' LATE DAY","Another Gunship floats beside the open door of the hangar. Padme and several Clone Troopers race out of it. In the hangar, the sound of the engines increases. Dooku's Sailor Ship takes off through a hangar portal. Padme and the Clone Troopers shoot at it, but it is too late. The Sailor Ship rises into the air and flies away into the sunset sky.","EXT. GEONOSIS -- SPACE ","Passing one of the rising Trade Federation battleships, the solar sails unfurl on Dooku's ship. It blurs away into hyperspace. ","INT. GEONOSIS SECRET HANGAR TOWER ' LATE DAY","Anakin slowly awakens, bathed in sweat and moaning in agony. Yoda sighs heavily at the sad sight and summons his gimer stick back into his hand, sagging onto it with all the weight of his advanced years. Obi-Wan slowly pulls himself up, hobbling on his injured leg. ","PADME: (O.S.) ANAKIN!!","Padme and the Clone Troopers rush in. The very sight of Padme reinvigorates Anakin, and he pulls himself up as well. Padme runs up to Anakin and throws her arms around him. Anakin is so tired and exhausted that he can barely stand.

I suggest you move the separatist leaders to Mustafar.","Grievous: It will be done, my lord.","Palpatine: The end of the war is near, General.","Grievous: But the loss of Count Dooku...","Palpatine: His death was a necessary loss. Soon I will have a new apprentice... one far younger and more powerful.","Padme: Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo.

I remember when I gave this to you.","Padme: How long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other?","Anakin: It was a dream.","Padme: Bad?","Anakin: Like the ones I used to have about my mother...just before she died.","Padme: And?","Anakin: And it was about you.","Padme: Tell me.","Anakin: It was only a dream. You die in childbirth.","Padme: And the baby?","Anakin: I don't know.","Padme: It was only a dream.","Anakin: I won't let this one become real.","Padme: This baby will change our lives. I doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate. And if the council discovers you're the father, you'll be expelled...","Anakin: I...I know. I know.","Padme: Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?","Anakin: We don't need his help. Our baby is a blessing.","Yoda: Premonitions? Premonitions. Hmm.

Yourselfyou speak of, or someoneyou know?","Anakin: Someone.","Yoda: Close to you?","Anakin: Yes.","Yoda: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.","Anakin: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.","Yoda: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is.","Anakin: What must I do, Master Yoda?","Yoda: Train yourself to let go...of everything you fear to lose.","Obi-Wan: You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.","Anakin: I'm sorry. I was held up. I have no excuse.","Obi-Wan: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.","Anakin: What's wrong, then?","Obi-Wan: The senate is expected...to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.","Anakin: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It'll make it easier for us to end this war.","Obi-Wan: Be careful of your friend Palpatine.","Anakin: Be careful of what?","Obi-Wan: He has requested your presence.","Anakin: What for?","Obi-Wan: He would not say.","Anakin: He didn't inform the council? That's unusual, isn't it?","Obi-Wan: All of this is unusual. And it's making me feel uneasy.","Palpatine: I hope you trust me, Anakin.","Anakin: Of course.","Palpatine: I need your help, son.","Anakin: What do you mean?","Palpatine: I'm depending on you.","Anakin: For what? I don't understand.","Palpatine: To be the eyes, ears and voice ofthe Republic. Anakin...I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.","Anakin: Me? A master? I'm overwhelmed, sir. But the council elects its own members. They'll never accept this.","Palpatine: I think they will. They need you. More than you know.","Yoda: Allow this appointment lightly the council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.","Anakin: I understand.","Mace Windu: You are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.","Anakin: What? How can you do this? This is outrageous. It's unfair. How can you be on the council and not be a master?","Mace Windu: Take a seat, young Skywalker.","Anakin: Forgive me, Master.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic...but have found no sign of General Grievous.","Yoda: Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is. The outlying systems you must sweep.","Obi-Wan: We do not have many ships to spare.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?","Mace Windu: It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.","Obi-Wan: He's right. It's a system we cannot afford to lose.","Yoda: Go I will. Good relations with the Wookiees I have.","Mace Windu: It's settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones... to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.","Anakin: What kind of nonsense is this? Put me on the council and not make me a master? It's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.","Obi-Wan: Oh, calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the council atyour age... it's never happened before. The fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor. The council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.","Anakin: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council.","Obi-Wan: But it's what you wanted. Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.","Anakin: That has nothing to do with this.","Obi-Wan: The only reason the council has approved your appointment... is because the chancellor trusts you.","Anakin: And?","Obi-Wan: Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't want to putyou in this situation.","Anakin: What situation?","Obi-Wan: The council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.","Anakin: They want me to spy on the chancellor? But that's treason.","Obi-Wan: We are at war, Anakin.","Anakin: Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?","Obi-Wan: This assignment is not to be on record.","Anakin: The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.","Obi-Wan: That is why you must help us. Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader... who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.","Anakin: The senate demanded that he stay longer.","Obi-Wan: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.","Anakin: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code... against the Republic, against a mentor and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this ofme?","Obi-Wan: The council is asking you.","Obi-Wan: Anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm.","Mace Windu: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.","Obi-Wan: With all due respect, Master, is he not the chosen one? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?","Mace Windu: So the prophecy says.","Yoda: A prophecy that misread could have been.","Obi-Wan: He will not let me down. He never has.","Yoda: I hope right you are.","Anakin: Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order. I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.","Padme: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?","Anakin: What do you mean?","Padme: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists... and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?","Anakin: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a separatist.","Padme: This war represents a failure to listen. Nowyou're closer to the chancellor than anyone. Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.","Anakin: Don't ask me to do that. Make a motion in the senate, where that kind ofa request belongs.","Padme: What is it?","Anakin: Nothing.","Padme: Don't do this. Don't shut me out. Let me help you. Hold me. Like you did by the lake on Naboo. So long ago, when there was nothing but our love. No politics, no plotting, no war.","Anakin: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.","Palpatine: Yes, Anakin. Come closer. I have good news.","Palpatine: Our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He's hiding in the Utapau system.","Anakin: At last. We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.","Palpatine: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council... if it didn't select you for this assignment. You're the best choice, by far.","Palpatine: Hmm. Sit down. Leave us.","Palpatine: Anakin...you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.","Anakin: I'm not sure I understand.","Palpatine: You must sense what I have come to suspect. The Jedi Council want control ofthe Republic. They're planning to betray me.","Anakin: I don't think that...","Palpatine: Anakin. Search your feelings. You know, don't you?","Anakin: I know they don't trust you.","Palpatine: Hmm. Or the senate. Or the Republic, or democracy, for that matter.","Anakin: I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.","Palpatine: Why? They asked you to do something... that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?","Anakin: I don't, uh...I don't know what to say.","Palpatine: Remember back to your early teachings. All who gain power are afraid to lose it. Even the Jedi.","Anakin: The Jedi use their power for good.","Palpatine: Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost everyway...including their quest for greater power.","Anakin: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards... only about themselves.","Palpatine: And the Jedi don't?","Anakin: The Jedi are selfless. They only care about others.","Palpatine: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?","Anakin: No.","Palpatine: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.","Palpatine: Darth Plagueis... was a dark lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise...he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians...to create... Iife.","Palpatine: He had such a knowledge ofthe dark side... he could even keep the ones he cared about...from dying.","Anakin: He could actually...save people from death?","Palpatine: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities...some consider to be unnatural.","Anakin: Wh...What happened to him?","Palpatine: He became so powerful...the only thing he was afraid of was...Iosing his power. Which eventually, of course, he did.","Palpatine: Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.","It's ironic. He could save others from death...but not himself.","Anakin: Is it possible to learn this power?","Palpatine: Not from a Jedi.","Clone Commander: All Redunits, overhere!","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?","Anakin: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet...from the chairman of Utapau.","Yoda: Hmm. Act on this we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.","Anakin: The chancellor has requested...that I lead the campaign.","Mace Windu: The council will make up its own mind who is to go...not the chancellor.","Yoda: A master is needed, with more experience.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.","Yoda: I agree.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Aye.","Mace Windu: Aye. Verywell. Council adjourned.","Clone Commander Gree: The droids have started up their main power generators.","Yoda: Then now the time is, Commander.","Clone Commander Gree: Yes, sir.","B1 Battle Droid: Charge!","Clone: Headfor cover!","Anakin: You're gonna need me on this one, Master.","Obi-Wan: Oh, I agree. However, it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.","Anakin: Master. I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been very appreciative ofyour training. I've been arrogant, and I apologize. I've just been so frustrated with the council.","Obi-Wan: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be. But be patient, Anakin. It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master.","Anakin: Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.","Obi-Wan: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.","Clone Commander Cody: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here. On the far side.","Obi-Wan: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.","Clone Commander Cody: Come on. When have I ever let you down?","Obi-Wan: Verywell. The burden is on me not to destroy all the droids until you arrive.","Obi-Wan: Save your energy.","Padme: I can't.","Obi-Wan: Don't give up, Padme.","Anakin: Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?","Padme: He came by this morning.","Anakin: What did he want?","Padme: He's worried about you. He says you've been under a lot of stress.","Anakin: I feel lost.","Padme: Lost? What do you mean?","Anakin: Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.","Padme: They trust you with their lives.","Anakin: Something's happening. I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more. And I know I shouldn't.","Padme: You expect too much of yourself.","Anakin: I found a way to save you.","Padme: Save me?","Anakin: From my nightmares.","Padme: Is that what's bothering you?","Anakin: I won't lose you, Padme.","Padme: I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani. I promise you.","Anakin: No, I promiseyou.","Tion Medon: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?","Obi-Wan: Unfortunately, the war.","Tion Medon: There's no war here...unless you brought it with you.","Obi-Wan: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel...and to use your city as a base as I searchnearby systems for General Grievous.","Tion Medon: He is here. We are being held hostage. They are watching us.","Obi-Wan: I understand.","Tion Medon: Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.","Obi-Wan: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.","Obi-Wan: Take the fighter back to the ship. Tell Cody I've made contact.","Pau'an Body Guard: Is he bringing additional warriors?","Tion Medon: He didn't say.","Grievous: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outerrim. It is a volcanic planet. You will be safe there.","Nute Gunray: Safe? Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General. Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.","Grievous: Be thankful, Viceroy...you have not found yourself in my grip. Your ship is waiting.","Obi-Wan: Hello there.","Grievous: General Kenobi. You are a bold one. Kill him.","Grievous: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.","Obi-Wan: Your move.","Grievous: You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku. Attack, Kenobi.","Grievous: Army or not...you must realize you are doomed.","Obi-Wan: Oh, I don't think so.","B1 Battle Droid: Uh-oh.","Obi-Wan: Hyah!","Clone Trooper: Cover that corner.","Clone Commander Cody: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous... and we have begun our attack.","Mace Windu: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.","Anakin: Yes, Master.","Mace Windu: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor.","Ki-Adi-Mundi: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous... then he should be removed from office.","Mace Windu: The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate... in order to secure a peaceful transition.","Yoda: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmm. Great care we must take.","Anakin: Chancellor. We've just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.","Palpatine: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.","Anakin: I should be there with him.","Palpatine: It's upsetting to me to see that the council...doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi master?","Anakin: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that...I'm being excluded from the council. I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me.","Palpatine: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you.","Palpatine: Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.","Anakin: How do you know the ways ofthe Force?","Palpatine: My mentor taught me everything about the Force. Even the nature of the dark side.","Anakin: You know the dark side?","Palpatine: Anakin...if one is to understand the great mystery...one must studyall its aspects...not just the dogmatic narrow view oftheJedi.","Palpatine: If you wish to become a complete and wise leader...you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.","Palpatine: Only through me...can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force...and you will be able to save yourwife...from certain death.","Anakin: What did you say?","Palpatine: Use my knowledge. I beg you.","Anakin: You're the Sith lord.","Palpatine: I know what's been troubling you. Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council. Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life... greater than that ofan ordinary Jedi. A life of significance...of conscience.","Palpatine: Areyou going to kill me?","Anakin: I would certainly like to.","Palpatine: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus...makes you stronger.","Anakin: I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.","Palpatine: Of course. You should. But you're not sure of their intentions, areyou?","Anakin: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.","Palpatine: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. Power to save Padme.","Grievous: Aaah!","Obi-Wan: So uncivilized.","Anakin: Master Windu, I must talk to you.","Mace Windu: Skywalker, we just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We're on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate.","Anakin: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.","Mace Windu: A Sith lord?","Anakin: Yes. The one we've been looking for.","Mace Windu: How do you know this?","Anakin: He knows the ways of the Force. He's been trained to use the dark side.","Mace Windu: Are you sure?","Anakin: Absolutely.","Mace Windu: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive.","Anakin: Master, the chancellor is very powerful. You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.","Mace Windu: For you own good, stay out ofthis affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.","Anakin: I must go, Master.","Mace Windu: No. If what you've told me is true...you will have gained my trust. But for now, remain here. Wait in the council chambers until we return.","Anakin: Yes, Master.","Palpatine: You do know, don't you...if the Jedi destroy me...any chance of saving her will be lost.","Palpatine: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say you're here sooner than expected.","Mace Windu: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic... you're under arrest, Chancellor.","Palpatine: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?","Mace Windu: The senate will decide your fate.","Palpatine: I am the senate.","Mace Windu: Not yet.","Palpatine: It's treason then.","Mace Windu: You are under arrest, my lord.","Palpatine: Anakin, I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.","Mace Windu: The oppression of the Sith will never return. You have lost.","Palpatine: No. No. No. You will die!","Palpatine: He's a traitor!","Mace; He is the traitor!","Palpatine: I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose.","Mace Windu: Don't listen to him, Anakin!","Palpatine: Don't let him kill me. I can't hold it any longer. I...I...I...I can't. I...I...I'm weak. I'm...I'm too weak.","Palpatine: Anakin. Help me. Help me! I...I...I can't hold on any longer.","Mace Windu: I am going to end this once and for all.","Anakin: You can't. He must stand trial.","Mace Windu: He has control of the senate and the courts. He's too dangerous to be left alive.","Palpatine: I'm too weak. Oh. Don't kill me. Please.","Anakin: It's not the Jedi way. He must live.","Palpatine: Please don't.","Anakin: I need him.","Palpatine: Please don't!","Anakin: No!","Palpatine: Power! Unlimited power!","Anakin: What have I done?","Palpatine: You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.","Anakin: I will do whatever you ask.","Palpatine: Good.","Anakin: Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her.","Palpatine: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved... but if we work together... I know we can discover the secret.","Anakin: I pledge myself... to your teachings.","Palpatine: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you.","Palpatine: A powerful Sith you will become.","Palpatine: Henceforth you shall be known as...Darth...Vader.","Anakin: Thankyou, my master.","Palpatine: Rise.","Palpatine: Because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice...I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot.","Palpatine: When the Jedi learn what has transpired here...they will kill us...along with all the senators.","Anakin: I agree.","Palpatine: The council's next move willbe against the senate. Every single Jedi...including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...is now an enemy of the Republic.","Anakin: I understand, Master.","Palpatine: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless. If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end.","Palpatine: First I want you to go to the Jedi temple. We will catch them off-balance.","Palpatine: Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.","Palpatine: Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side...to save Padme.","Anakin: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?","Palpatine: Their betrayal will be dealt with. Afteryou have killed all the Jedi in the temple...go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...and the other separatist leaders.","Palpatine: Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy! And...we shall have... peace.","Clone Trooper: Sergeant, over here! Hurry! Follow them!","Clone Trooper: All Red units, let's move it!","Clone Trooper: Come on. Let's go!","Obi-Wan: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.","Clone Commander Cody: Very good, sir. Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.","Obi-Wan: Thank you, Cody. Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here. Hyah!","Clone Commander Cody: Yes, sir.","Palpatine: Commander Cody...the time has come. Execute order 66.","Clone Commander Cody: Yes, my lord. Blast him!","Ki-Adi-Mundi: Come on!","Palpatine: Execute order 66.","Clone Jag and CT-57/11-9048: It will be done, my lord.","Clone Commander Bly: It will be done, my lord.","Sors Bandeam: Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?","C-3PO: The chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple. Don't worry. I...I'm sure he'll be all right.","Bail Organa: What's going on here?","Clone Officer Appo: There's been a rebellion, sir. Don't worry. The situation is under control. I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.","Bail Organa: And so it is.","Clone Officer Appo: Get him!","Bail Organa: No!","Clone Officer Appo: Don't worry about him. Let him go.","Clone Sergeant: All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.","Clone Trooper: Yes, sir.","Yoda: Good-bye, Tarfful. Good-bye, Chewbacca. Miss you I will.","Bail Organa: Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a fewJedi...before they walk into this catastrophe.","Clone Commander Cody: Did you find Kenobi?","Clone Trooper: Sir, no one could have survived that fall.","Clone Commander Cody: Start loading your men on the ships. Move it.","Obi-Wan: Emergency code 91 3. I have no contact on any frequency.","Bail Organa: Master Kenobi.","Obi-Wan: Repeat.","Bail Organa: Master Kenobi.","Obi-Wan: Senator Organa. My clone troops turned on me. I need help.","Bail Organa: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.","C-3PO: Hush! Not so loud.","Padme: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple. You could see the smoke from here.","Anakin: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.","Padme: What's happening?","Anakin: The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic.","Padme: I can't believe that.","Anakin: I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself.","Padme: Oh, Anakin. What are you gonna do?","Anakin: I will not betray the Republic. My loyalties lie with the chancellor...and with the senate and with you.","Padme: What about Obi-Wan?","Anakin: I don't know. Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.","Padme: Anakin, I'm afraid.","Anakin: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The chancellor has given me a very important mission.","Anakin: The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return. Things will be different. I promise.","Anakin: Please, wait for me.","C-3PO: Well, he is under a lot ofstress, R2. Take care, my little friend.","C-3PO: Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?","Padme: No, thank you, 3PO.","C-3PO: Oh. I...I feel so helpless.","Obi-Wan: How many other Jedi have managed to survive?","Yoda: Heard from no one have we.","Bail Organa: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.","Obi-Wan: Have we had any contact from the temple?","Yoda: Received a coded retreat message we have.","Bail Organa: It requests all Jedi to return to the temple. It says the war is over.","Obi-Wan: Well, then we must go back. If there are any stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.","Yoda: Hmm. Suggest dismantling the coded signal, doyou?","Obi-Wan: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.","Yoda: I agree. And a little more knowledge might light ourway.","Nute Gunray: The plan has gone as you had promised, my lord.","Palpatine: You have done well, Viceroy.","Palpatine: When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives... he will take care of you.","Bail Organa's Pilot: We're receiving a message from the chancellor's office, sir.","Bail Organa: Send it through.","Bail Organa's Pilot: Yes, sir.","Mas Ameda: Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor requests your presence...at a special session of Congress.","Bail Organa: I will be there.","Mas Ameda: He'll be expecting you.","Bail Organa: Could be a trap.","Obi-Wan: I don't think so. The chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems... without keeping the senate intact.","Bail Organa: If a special session of Congress there is...easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be.","Anakin: R2, stay with the ship.","Nute Gunray: Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.","Palpatine: And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.","Bail Organa: What's happened?","Padme: The chancellor's been elaborating...on a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.","Palpatine: The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.","Obi-Wan: Not even the younglings survived.","Yoda: Killed not by clones...this Padawan. By a lightsaber he was.","Obi-Wan: Who? Who could have done this?","Palpatine: The attempt on my life...has left me scarred...and deformed.But I assure you. My resolve has never been stronger!","Rune Haako: Stop! No!","Palpatine: In order to ensure the security...and continuing stability...the Republic will be reorganized...into the first Galactic Empire! For a safe...and secure society.","Padme: So this is how liberty dies. With thunderous applause.","Nute Gunray: The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want...","Obi-Wan: I have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.","Yoda: For the clones...to discover the recalibration a long time it will take.","Obi-Wan: Wait. Master. There is something I must know.","Yoda: If into the security recordings you go...only pain will you find.","Obi-Wan: I must know the truth, Master.","Obi-Wan: It can't be. It can't be.","Palpatine: You have done well, my new apprentice. Now, Lord Vader...go and bring peace to the Empire.","Obi-Wan: I can't watch any more.","Yoda: Destroy the Sith we must.","Obi-Wan: Send me to kill the emperor. I will not kill Anakin.","Yoda: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not.","Obi-Wan: He is like my brother. I cannot do it.","Yoda: Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is. Consumed by Darth Vader.","Obi-Wan: I do not know where the emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.","Yoda: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will.","Obi-Wan: When was the last time you saw him?","Padme: Yesterday.","Obi-Wan: And do you know where he is now?","Padme: No.","Obi-Wan: Padme, I need your help. He is in grave danger.","Padme: From the Sith?","Obi-Wan: From himself. Padme...Anakin has turned to the dark side.","Padme: You're wrong. How could you even say that?","Obi-Wan: I have seen a...a security hologram...of him...killing younglings.","Padme: Not Anakin. He couldn't.","Obi-Wan: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith lord we've been looking for.","Obi-Wan: After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.","Padme: I don't believe you. I can't.","Obi-Wan: Padme...I must find him.","Padme: You're going to kill him, aren't you?","Obi-Wan: He has become a very great threat.","Padme: I can't.","Obi-Wan: Anakin is the father, isn't he? I'm so sorry.","Captain Typho: Milady, let me come with you.","Padme: There's no danger. The fighting's over. And this is personal.","Captain Typho: As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree.","Padme: I'll be all right, Captain. This is something I must do myself. Besides, 3PO will look after me.","C-3PO: Oh, dear. Do you know? I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business. Hmm.","Anakin: The separatists have been taken care of, my master.","Palpatine: It is finished then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.","Palpatine: Send a message to the ships ofthe Trade Federation. All droid units must shut down immediately.","Anakin: Very good, my lord.","Anakin: I saw your ship. What are you doing out here?","Padme: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.","Anakin: What things?","Padme: He said you've turned to the dark side. That you...killed younglings.","Anakin: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.","Padme: He cares about us.","Anakin: Us?","Padme: He knows. He wants to help you.","Padme: Anakin, all I want is your love.","Anakin: Love won't saveyou, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.","Padme: At what cost? You're a good person. Don't do this.","Anakin: I won't loseyou the way I lost my mother.","Anakin: I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of. And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.","Padme: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.","Anakin: Don't you see? We don't have to run away anymore.","Anakin: I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the chancellor. I...I can overthrow him.","Anakin: And together, you and I can rule the galaxy...make things the way we want them to be.","Padme: I don't believe what I'm hearing. Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.","Anakin: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.","Anakin: The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.","Padme: I don't know you anymore. Anakin...you're breaking my heart. You're going down a path I can't follow.","Anakin: Because of Obi-Wan?","Padme: Because of what you've done. What you plan to do. Stop. Stop now. Come back. I love you.","Anakin: Liar!","Padme: No.","Anakin: You're with him! You brought him here to kill me.","Padme: No.","Obi-Wan: Let her go, Anakin. Anakin. Let her go.","Anakin: You turned her against me!","Obi-Wan: You have done that yourself.","Anakin: You will not take her from me!","Obi-Wan: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.","Obi-Wan: You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now- until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.","Anakin: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi.","Anakin: I do not fear the dark side as you do.","Anakin: I have brought peace...freedom, justice...and security to my new empire.","Obi-Wan: Your new empire?","Anakin: Don't make me kill you.","Obi-Wan: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!","Anakin: If you're not with me...then you're my enemy.","Obi-Wan: Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.","Anakin: You will try.","Yoda: I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor. Or should I call you Darth Sidious?","Palpatine: MasterYoda. You survived.","Yoda: Surprised?","Palpatine: Your arrogance blinds you, MasterYoda. Nowyou will experience...the full power of the dark side.","Palpatine: I have waited a long time...for this moment...my little green friend.","Palpatine: At last the Jedi are no more.","Yoda: Not if anything to say about it I have.","Palpatine: Aaah!","Yoda: At an end your rule is. And not short enough it was.","Yoda: If so powerful you are...why leave?","Palpatine: You will not stop me. Darth Vaderwill become more powerful than either of us.","Yoda: Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be. As is your faith in the dark side ofthe Force.","Yoda: Hurry. Careful timing we will need.","Bail Organa: Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.","Clone Commander Thire: There's no sign of his body, sir.","Mas Ameda: Then he is not dead.","Palpatine: Double your search.","Clone Commander Thire: Yes, sir. Right away, sir.","Palpatine: Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.","Mas Ameda: Yes, Master.","Palpatine: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.","Yoda: Into exile I must go. Failed I have.","Obi-Wan: I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you.","Anakin: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over.","Obi-Wan: Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!","Anakin: From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.","Obi-Wan: Well, then you are lost!","Anakin: This is the end for you, my master.","Obi-Wan: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.","Anakin: You underestimate my power.","Obi-Wan: Don't try it.","Obi-Wan: You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them!","Obi-Wan: Bring balance to the Force...not leave it in darkness!","Anakin: I hate you!","Obi-Wan: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.","C-3PO: Oh. Master Kenobi. Um, we have Miss Padme on board. Yes. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.","Padme: Obi-Wan. Is Anakin all right?","Clone Captain Kagi: Your Majesty, this way.","Palpatine: There he is. He's still alive.","Palpatine: Get a medical capsule immediately.","Clone Captain Kagi: Yes, sir. Right away.","Bail Organa: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.","Bail Organa: We'll take her to the medical center. Quickly.","GH-7 Medical Analysis Unit: Medically, she's completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.","Obi-Wan: She's dying?","GH-7 Medical Analysis Unit: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.","Bail Organa: Babies?","GH-7 Medical Analysis Unit: She's carrying twins.","Midwife Droid: Ee-see-tah oy-doh.","Padme: Luke. Oh, Luke.","Midwife Droid: Ooh-bah, ooh-bah. Ee-see-tah oy-dah.","Obi-Wan: It's a girl.","Padme: Leia.","Padme: Obi-Wan? There's good in him. I know. I know there's...still...","Palpatine: Lord Vader. Can you hear me?","Anakin: Yes, Master. Where is Padme? Is she safe? Is she all right?","Palpatine: It seems, in your anger, you killed her.","Anakin: I? I couldn't have. She was alive. I felt it! No!","Yoda: Hidden, safe the children must be kept.","Obi-Wan: We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence.","Yoda: Hmm. Split up they should be.","Bail Organa: My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.","Obi-Wan: And what of the boy?","Yoda: To Tatooine. To his family send him.","Obi-Wan: I will take the child and watch over him.","Yoda: Until the time is right, disappear we will.","Yoda: Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.","Obi-Wan: Training?","Yoda: An old friend has learned the path to immortality. One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force. Your old master.","Obi-Wan: Qui-Gon?","Yoda: How to commune with him I will teach you.","Bail Organa: Captain Antilles.","Raymus Antilles: Yes, Your Highness?","Bail Organa: I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.","C-3PO: What? Oh, no."],[mm.hope]:["3PO: Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure.","3PO: This is madness. We're doomed.","3PO: There'll be no escape for the princess this time.","3PO: What's that?","3PO: R2-D2, where are you?","3PO: At last. Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.","3PO: What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what.","3PO: Wait a minute. Where are you going?","Storm Trooper: The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.","Vader: Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans?","Raymus: We intercepted no transmissions. This is a consular ship. We're on a diplomatic mission.","Vader: If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?","Vader: Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans! And bring me the passengers! I want them alive!","Trooper: There's one. Set for stun.","Trooper: She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.","3PO: Hey. You're not permitted in there. It's restricted.","3PO: You'll be deactivated for sure.","3PO: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease. Come out, before somebody sees you.","3PO: Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there.","3PO: I'm going to regret this.","Hija: There goes another one.","Bolvan: Hold your fire. There's no life-forms. It must have short-circuited.","3PO: That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this thing is safe?","Leia: Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...","Vader: Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time.","Vader: Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.","Leia: I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.","Vader: You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. Take her away!","Daine Jir: Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.","Vader: I have traced the rebel spies to her.

No, not that one.","Owen: You. I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.","3PO: Protocol? It's my primary function, sir. I am well-versed in all the customs...","Owen: I have no need for a protocol droid.","3PO: Of course you haven't, sir. Not in an environment such as this. That's why I have been programmed...","Owen: I need a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.","3PO: Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters...very similar to your vaporators in most respects.","Owen: Can you speak Bocce?","3PO: Of course. It's like a second language.","Owen: All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.","3PO: Shutting up, sir.","Owen: Luke! Take these two to the garage. I want them cleaned up before dinner.","Luke: But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters.","Owen: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on. Get to it.","Luke: All right. Come on. And the red one. Come on.","Luke: Come on, red. Let's go. Uncle Owen.","Owen: Yeah?","Luke: This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.","Owen: Hey, what are you trying to push on us?","3PO: Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain.","Luke: Uncle Owen, what about that one?","Owen: What about that blue one? We'll take that one.","Luke: Take this away.","3PO: You'll be pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.","Luke: Okay. Let's go.","3PO: Don't you forget this. Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity.","3PO: Thank the maker. This oil bath is going to feel so good.","3PO: I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move.","Luke: It just isn't fair. Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here.","3PO: Is there anything I might do to help?","Luke: No, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest...or teleport me off this rock.","3PO: I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.","Luke: Well, if there's a bright center to the universe...you're on the planet that it's farthest from.","3PO: I see, sir.","Luke: You can call me Luke.","3PO: I see, Sir Luke.","Luke: Just Luke.","3PO: And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.","Luke: Hello. You got a lot of carbon scoring here. Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.","3PO: With all we've been through...sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are...what with the rebellion and all.","Luke: You know of the rebellion against the Empire?","3PO: That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.","Luke: Have you been in many battles?","3PO: Several, I think. There's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.","Luke: Well, my little friend...you got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a Starcruiser or...","Leiah: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.","Luke: What's this?",'3PO: "What is what"? He asked you a question. What is that?',"Leia: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.","3PO: He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.","Luke: Who is she? She's beautiful.","3PO: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, I believe. Our captain was...","Luke: Is there any more to this recording?","3PO: Behave yourself, R2. You're going to get us into trouble. It's all right. You can trust him. He's our new master.","Leia: You're my only hope.","3PO: He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts...and it's a private message for him.","3PO: Frankly, I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles. But with all we've been through, this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.","Luke: Obi-Wan Kenobi. I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.","3PO: I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?","Luke: I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan...but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.","Luke: I wonder who she is. Sounds like she's in trouble. I better play back the whole thing.","3PO: He says the restraining bolt has short-circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt...he might be able to play back the entire recording.","Luke: Oh, yeah. Well...I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off.","Luke: Okay. There you go. Where'd she go? Bring her back. Play back the entire message.","3PO: \"What message\"? The one you've just been playing. The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards.","Beru: Luke! Luke!","Luke: I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.","3PO: I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.","Luke: Here. See what you can do with him. I'll be right back.","3PO: Just you reconsider playing that message for him.","3PO: No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.","Luke: I think that R2 unit might have been stolen.","Owen: What makes you think that?","Luke: I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben.","Luke: Do you know what he's talking about? I wonder if he's related to Ben.","Owen: That wizard's just a crazy old man. Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.","Owen: That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.","Luke: But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?","Owen: He won't. I don't think he exists anymore. He died about the same time as your father.","Luke: He knew my father?","Owen: I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow.","Owen: In the morning, I want them on the south ridge, working on those condensers.","Luke: Yes, sir. I think those new droids are gonna work out fine. In fact, I was also thinking about our agreement...about me staying on another season.","Luke: If these new droids work out, I want to apply to the academy this year.","Owen: You mean the next semester before the harvest?","Luke: Sure. There's more than enough droids.","Owen: Harvest is when I need you the most. It's only one season more.","Owen: This year we'll make enough on the harvest to hire more hands...and then you can go to the academy next year.","Owen: You must understand I need you here, Luke.","Luke: But it's a whole 'nother year.","Owen: It's only one more season.","Luke: That's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.","Beru: Where are you going?","Luke: Looks like I'm going nowhere.","Luke: I have to go finish cleaning those droids.","Beru: Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.","Owen: I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.","Beru: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.","Owen: That's what I'm afraid of.","Luke: What are you doing hiding back there?","3PO: It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning. Kept babbling on about his mission.","Luke: Oh, no.","3PO: That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times.","Luke: How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!","3PO: Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?","Luke: It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait till morning.","Owen: Luke, I'm shutting the power down.","Luke: I'll be there in a few minutes.","Luke: Boy, am I gonna get it. That little droid's gonna cause me a lot of trouble.","3PO: He excels at that, sir.","Luke: Come on.","Owen: Luke? Luke! Have you seen Luke this morning?","Beru: He said he had things to do before he started today, so he left early.","Owen: Did he take those new droids with him?","Beru: I think so.","Owen: He better have those units in the south range repaired by midday...or there'll be hell to pay.","Luke: There's a droid on the scanner. Dead ahead. It might be our little R2 unit. Hit the accelerator.","Luke: Where do you think you're going?","3PO: Master Luke is your rightful owner now. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.","3PO: Don't talk to me of your mission either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.","Luke: No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go. What's wrong with him now?","3PO: There are several creatures approaching from the southeast.","Luke: Sandpeople. Or worse. Come on. Let's go have a look. Come on.","Luke: Well, there are two Banthas down there, but I don't see any... Wait a second. They're Sandpeople, all right. I can see one of them now.","Obi-Wan: Hello there.","Obi-Wan: Come here, my little friend. Don't be afraid.","Obi-Wan: Don't worry. He'll be all right.","Obi-Wan: Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day. You're fortunate to be all in one piece.","Luke: Ben? Ben Kenobi? Boy, am I glad to see you.","Obi-Wan: The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.","Obi-Wan: Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?","Luke: This little droid. I think he's searching for his former master...but I've never seen such devotion in a droid before.","Luke: He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?","Obi-Wan: Obi-Wan Kenobi? Obi-Wan.","Obi-Wan: Now, that's a name I've not heard in a long time. A long time.","Luke: I think my uncle knows him. He said he was dead.","Obi-Wan: He's not dead. Not yet.","Luke: You know him?","Obi-Wan: Of course I know him. He's me.","Obi-Wan: I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...since, oh, before you were born.","Luke: Then the droid does belong to you.","Obi-Wan: I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting.","Obi-Wan: I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled...but they'll soon be back...and in greater numbers.","Luke: 3PO","3PO: Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.","Luke: Can you stand? We've gotta get out of here before the Sandpeople return.","3PO: I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke.","3PO: There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.","Luke: No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?","Obi-Wan: Quickly. They're on the move.","Luke: My father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.","Obi-Wan: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.","Luke: You fought in the Clone Wars?","Obi-Wan: Yes. I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.","Luke: I wish I'd known him.","Obi-Wan: He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.","Obi-Wan: And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...","Obi-Wan: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough...but your uncle wouldn't allow it.","Obi-Wan: He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan...on some damn-fool idealistic crusade, like your father did.","3PO: Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for a while.","Luke: Sure. Go ahead.","Luke: What is it?","Obi-Wan: Your father's lightsaber.","Obi-Wan: This is the weapon of a Jedi knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.","Obi-Wan: An elegant weapon...for a more civilized age.","Obi-Wan: For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights...were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic...before the dark times...before the Empire.","Luke: How did my father die?","Obi-Wan: A young Jedi named Darth Vader...who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil...helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.","Obi-Wan: He betrayed and murdered your father.","Obi-Wan: Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.","Luke: The Force?","Obi-Wan: The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.","Obi-Wan: Let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend...and where you come from.","Luke: I saw part of a message...","Obi-Wan: I seem to have found it.","Leia: General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.","Leia: I regret that I am unable to present my father's request in person. But my ship has fallen under attack...and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.","Leia: I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion...into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it.","Leia: You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour.","Leia: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.","Obi-Wan: You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.","Luke: Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've gotta get home. It's late. I'm in for it as it is.","Obi-Wan: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.","Luke: I can't get involved. I've got work to do.","Luke: It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it. But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's all such a long way from here.","Obi-Wan: That's your uncle talking.","Luke: Oh, boy. My uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?","Obi-Wan: Learn about the Force, Luke.","Luke: I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.","Obi-Wan: You must do what you feel is right, of course.","Tagge: Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable.","Tagge: The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.","Motti: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...not to this battle station.","Tagge: The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate...","Tarkin: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.","Tarkin: The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away.","Tagge: That's impossible. How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?","Tarkin: The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.","Tarkin: Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.","Tagge: And what of the rebellion? If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station...it is possible, however unlikely...that they might find a weakness and exploit it.","Vader: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.","Motti: Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture...no matter what technical data they've obtained.","Motti: This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it.","Vader: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.","Vader: The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant...next to the power of the Force.","Motti: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.","Motti: Your sad devotion to that ancient religion...has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes...or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortress...","Vader: I find your lack of faith disturbing.","Tarkin: Enough of this. Vader, release him.","Vader: As you wish.","Tarkin: This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress...by the time this station is operational.","Tarkin: We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke.","Luke: It looks like the Sandpeople did this. There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. I've just never heard of them hitting anything this big before.","Obi-Wan: They didn't, but we are meant to think they did.","Obi-Wan: These tracks are side-by-side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers.","Luke: These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO.","Obi-Wan: And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.","Luke: But why would imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?","Luke: If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to...and that would lead them back... home.","Obi-Wan: Wait, Luke. It's too dangerous.","Luke: Uncle Owen. Aunt Beru. Uncle Owen.","Vader: Now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base.","Obi-Wan: There's nothing you could have done, had you been there. You'd have been killed too...and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.","Luke: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now.","Luke: I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.","Obi-Wan: Mos Eisley spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.","Sandtroooper: How long have you had these droids?","Luke: Three or four seasons.","Obi-Wan: They're up for sale if you want them.","Sandtroooper: Let me see your identification.","Obi-Wan: You don't need to see his identification.","Sandtroooper: We don't need to see his identification.","Obi-Wan: These aren't the droids you're looking for.","Sandtroooper: These aren't the droids we're looking for.","Obi-Wan: He can go about his business.","Sandtroooper: You can go about your business.","Obi-Wan: Move along.","Sandtroooper: Move along. Move along.","3PO: I can't abide those Jawas. Disgusting creatures.","Luke: Go on, go on.","Luke: I can't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.","Obi-Wan: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.","Luke: You really think we're gonna find a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?","Obi-Wan: Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here.","Obi-Wan: Only watch your step...this place can be a little rough.","Luke: I'm ready for anything.","3PO: Come along, R2.","Wuher: Hey. We don't serve their kind here.","Luke: What?","Wuher: Your droids... they'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.","Luke: Wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble.","3PO: I heartily agree with you, sir.","Luke: I'll have one of those.","Evazan: He doesn't like you.","Luke: I'm sorry.","Evazan: I don't like you either.","Evazan: You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on 12 systems.","Luke: I'll be careful then.","Evazan: You'll be dead!","Obi-Wan: This little one's not worth the effort. Come, let me get you something.","Luke: I'm all right.","Obi-Wan: Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.","3PO: I don't like the look of this.","Han: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.","Obi-Wan: Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.","Han: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?","Obi-Wan: Should I have?","Han: It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.","Han: I've outrun imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man.","Han: What's the cargo?","Obi-Wan: Only passengers...myself, the boy, two droids...and no questions asked.","Han: Is it some kind of local trouble?","Obi-Wan: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements.","Han: Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? And it's gonna cost you something extra. 10000","Luke: 10000? We could almost buy our own ship for that.","Han: But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?","Luke: You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot. We don't have to sit here and listen...","Obi-Wan: We can pay you 2,000 now...plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.","Han: Seventeen? Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.","Han: We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking Bay 94.","Obi-Wan: Ninety-four.","Han: Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.","Sandtroooper: All right. We'll check it out.","Han: Seventeen thousand,  must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship, get it ready.","Obi-Wan: You'll have to sell your speeder.","Luke: That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.","Greedo: Going somewhere, Solo?","Han: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.","Greedo: It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance.","Greedo: Jabba's put a price on your head so large...every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you...I'm lucky I found you first.","Han: Yeah, but this time I've got the money.","Greedo: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.","Han: I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...","Greedo: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers...who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.","Han: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?","Greedo: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.","Han: Over my dead body.","Greedo: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.","Han: I'll bet you have.","Greedo: Maclunkey","Han: Sorry about the mess.","Vader: Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her.","Motti: The final checkout is completed. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?","Tarkin: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.","Vader: What do you mean?","Tarkin: I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station. Set your course for Alderaan.","Motti: With pleasure.","3PO: Lock the door, R2.","Sandtrooper: Check this side of the street. The door's locked. Move on to the next one.","3PO: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.","3PO: I don't know what this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language.","Luke: All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.","Luke: Look at this. Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.","Obi-Wan: It'll be enough.","Jaba: Solo! Come out of there, Solo!","Han: Right here, Jabba. I've been waitin' for you.","Jabba: Have you now.","Han: You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?","Jabba: Han, my boy, you disappoint me. Why haven't you paid me...and why did you fry poor Greedo?","Han: Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come see me yourself. Don't send one of these twerps.","Jabba: Han, I can't make exceptions. What if everyone who smuggled for me...dropped their cargo at the first sign...of an imperial starship? It's not good business.","Han: Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes. You think I had a choice?","Han: But I got a nice, easy charter. I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra. I just need a little more time.","Jabba: Han, my boy, you're the best.","Jabba: So, for an extra twenty percent...","Han: Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.","Jabba: Okay, fifteen percent. But if you fail me again...I'll put a price on your head so big...you won't be able to go near a civilized system.","Han: Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.","Jabba: Come on!","Obi-Wan: If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.","Luke: What a piece of junk.","Han: She'll make .5 past light speed. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've made a lot of special modifications myself. But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board, we'll get outta here.","3PO: Hello, sir.","Trooper: Which way? All right, men, load your weapons.","Trooper: Stop that ship. Blast them.","Han: Chewie, get us out of here!","3PO: Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.","Han: Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our passengers are hotter than I thought. Hold 'em off. Angle the deflector shields... while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.","Han: Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in. They're gonna try and cut us off.","Luke: Why don't you outrun 'em? You said this thing was fast.","Han: Watch your mouth or you're gonna find yourself floating home.","Han: We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.","Han: Here's where the fun begins.","Obi-Wan: How long before you can jump to light speed?","It'll takHan: e a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.","Luke: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining?","Han: Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy.","Han: Without precise calculations, we'd fly right through a star...or bounce too close to a supernova, and that would end your trip real quick.","Luke: What's that flashing?","Han: We're losing a deflector shield. Go strap yourselves in. I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.","Motti: We've entered the Alderaan system.","Leia: Governor Tarkin. I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.","Tarkin: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it...signing the order to terminate your life.","Leia: I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.","Tarkin: Princess Leia, before your execution...I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony...that will make this battle station operational.","Tarkin: No star system will dare oppose the emperor now.","Leia: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin... the more star systems will slip through your fingers.","Tarkin: Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.","Tarkin: In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet...that'll be destroyed first.","Tarkin: Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base...","Tarkin: I have chosen to test this station's destructive power...on your home planet of Alderaan.","Leia: No. Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons.","Tarkin: You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system.","Tarkin: I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time. Where is the rebel base?","Leia: Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.","Tarkin: There. You see, Lord Vader? She can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.","Leia: What?","Tarkin: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.","Tenn Graneet: Commence primary ignition.","Luke: Are you all right? What's wrong?","Obi-Wan: I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror...and were suddenly silenced.","Obi-Wan: I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises.","Han: You can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun them.","Han: Don't everybody thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours.","3PO: Now be careful, R2. He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.","Han: Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.","3PO: But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.","Han: That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.","3PO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, R2. Let the Wookiee win.","Obi-Wan: Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.","Luke: You mean it controls your actions?","Obi-Wan: Partially. But it also obeys your commands.","Han: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a blaster at your side, kid.","Luke: You don't believe in the Force, do you?","Han: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff...but I've never seen anything to make me believe...there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny.","Han: It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.","Obi-Wan: I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self... and act on instinct.","Luke: With the blast shield down, I can't see. How am I supposed to fight?","Obi-Wan: Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.","Obi-Wan: Stretch out with your feelings.","Obi-Wan: You see? You can do it.","Han: I call it luck.","Obi-Wan: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.","Han: Good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living, that's something else.","Han: We're coming up on Alderaan.","Luke: I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.","Obi-Wan: That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world.","Tarkin: Yes?","Siward Cass: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a rebel base... but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.","Siward Cass: They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.","Tarkin: She lied. She lied to us.","Vader: I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion.","Tarkin: Terminate her immediately.","Han: Stand by, Chewie. Here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.","Han: What the... We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower... some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.","Luke: What's going on?","Han: Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.","Luke: Where is it?","Han: That's what I'm trying to tell you. It ain't there. It's been blown away.","Luke: What? How?","Obi-Wan: Destroyed by the Empire.","Han: The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more firepower than I've...","Han: There's another ship coming in.","Luke: Maybe they know what happened.","Obi-Wan: It's an imperial fighter.","Luke: It followed us.","Obi-Wan: No. It's a short-range fighter.","Han: There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?","Luke: Sure is leaving in a hurry. If they identify us, we're in trouble.","Han: Not if I can help it. Chewie, jam its transmissions.","Obi-Wan: Let it go. It's too far out of range.","Han: Not for long.","Obi-Wan: A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.","Luke: He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.","Han: He ain't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us.","Luke: He's heading for that small moon.","Han: I can get him before he gets there. He's almost in range.","Obi-Wan: That's no moon. It's a space station.","Han: It's too big to be a space station.","Luke: I have a very bad feeling about this.","Obi-Wan: Turn the ship around.","Han: Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse. Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.","Han: Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.","Luke: Why are we still moving towards it?","Han: We're caught in a tractor beam. It's pulling us in.","Luke: There's gotta be something you can do.","Han: There's nothing I can do. I'm at full power. I have to shut down. They're not gonna get me without a fight.","Obi-Wan: You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting.","Trooper: Clear Bay 327. We are opening the magnetic field.","Trooper: To your stations. Come with me. Close all outboard shields. Close all outboard shields.","Tarkin: Yes?","Officer: We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. Its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.","Vader: They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us.","Officer: Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9. Release charge.","Edmos Khurgee: There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy. Several escape pods have been jettisoned.","Vader: Did you find any droids?","Edmos Khurgee: No, sir. If there were any, they must also have jettisoned.","Vader: Send a scanning crew aboard. I want every part of this ship checked.","Edmos Khurgee: Yes, sir.","Vader: I sense something... a presence I've not felt since...","Edmos Khurgee: Get me a scanning crew in here. I want every part of this ship checked.","Trooper: There's no one here.","Luke: Boy, it's lucky you have these compartments.","Han: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.","Obi-Wan: Leave that to me.","Han: Damn fool. I knew you were gonna say that.","Obi-Wan: Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?","Trooper: The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.","Trooper: All right. Let's go.","Han: Hey, down there. Could you give us a hand with this?","Officer: TK-421, why aren't you at your post? TK-421, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do.","Luke: Between his howling and your blasting everything... it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.","Han: Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight to sneakin' around.","3PO: We've found the computer outlet, sir.","Obi-Wan: Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network.","3PO: He's found the controls to the power beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.","3PO: The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.","Obi-Wan: I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.","Han: Whatever you say. I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.","Luke: I want to go with you.","Obi-Wan: Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids. They must be delivered safely... or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.","Obi-Wan: Your destiny lies along a different path from mine. The Force will be with you... always.","Han: You said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil?","Luke: Ben is a great man.","Han: Great at getting us into trouble.","Luke: I didn't hear you give any ideas.","Han: Anything's better than just hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up.","Luke: Who do you think... What is it?","3PO: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says, \"I've found her,\" and keeps repeating, \"She's here.\"","Luke: Who? Who has he found?","3PO: Princess Leia.","Luke: The princess? She's here?","Han: Princess?","Luke: Where is she?","Han: Princess? What's going on?","3PO: Level 5, Detention Block AA-23. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.","Luke: Oh, no. We've gotta do something.","Han: What are you talking about?","Luke: The droids belong to her. She's the one in the message. We gotta help her.","Han: Don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait here.","Luke: He didn't know she was here. Find a way into that detention block.","Han: I'm not going anywhere.","Luke: They're gonna execute her. You said you didn't want to just wait to be captured. Now you want to stay?","Han: Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.","Luke: But they're gonna kill her.","Han: Better her than me.","Luke: She's rich.","Han: Rich?","Luke: Rich, powerful. If you were to rescue her, the reward would be...","Han: What?","Luke: Well, more well than you can imagine.","Han: I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.","Luke: You'll get it.","Han: I better.","Luke: You will.","Han: All right, kid. You better be right about this.","Luke: All right.","Han: What's your plan?","Luke: 3PO hand me those binders will you? Okay. Now, I'm gonna put these on you.","Han: Okay, Han, you put those on.","Luke: Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.","3PO: Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking... but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?","Luke: Lock the door.","Han: And hope they don't have blasters.","3PO: That isn't very reassuring.","Chewie: Grrr!","Officer: 517 to scan control. 517 to scan control.","Luke: I can't see a thing in this helmet.","Han: This is not gonna work.","Luke: Why didn't you say so before?","Han: I did say so before.","Shann Childsen: Where are you taking this... thing?","Luke: Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.","Shann Childsen: I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.","Han: Look out! He's loose!","Luke: He'll tear us all apart!","Han: I'll get him!","Han: Look out.","Han: We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... 2187. You go and get her. I'll hold them here.","Han: Everything's under control. Situation normal.","Officer: What happened?","Han: Had a slight weapons malfunction... but everything's perfectly all right now.","Han: We're fine. We're all fine here now. Thank you. How are you?","Officer: We're sending a squad up.","Han: Negative, negative. We have a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak, very dangerous.","Officer: Who is this? What's your operating number?","Han: Boring conversation anyway. Luke, we're gonna have company!","Leia: Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?","Luke: Oh, the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.","Leia: You're who?","Luke: I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.","Leia: Ben Kenobi? Where is he?","Luke: Come on.","Vader: He is here.","Tarkin: Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you think so?","Vader: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.","Tarkin: Surely he must be dead by now.","Vader: Don't underestimate the Force.","Tarkin: The Jedi are extinct. Their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes.","We have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23.","Tarkin: The princess? Put all sections on alert.","Vader: Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.","Tarkin: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.","Vader: Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.","Han: Get behind me. Get behind me.","Trooper: Watch your left. They went down the cell bay.","Han: Can't get out that way.","Leia: You cut off our only escape route.","Han: Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.","Luke: C-3PO. C-3PO.","3PO: Yes, sir?","Luke: Are there any other ways out of the cell bay? We've been cut off.","Luke: What was that? I didn't copy.","3PO: I said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out. All other information on your level is restricted.","Trooper: Open up in there. Open up in there.","3PO: Oh, no.","Luke: There isn't any other way out.","Han: I can't hold them off forever. Now what?","Leia: This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?","Han: He's the brains, sweetheart.","Luke: Well, I didn't...","Han: What the hell are you doing?","Leia: Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, flyboy.","Han: Get in there! Get in there, you big furry oaf. I don't care what you smell. Get in there, and don't worry about it.","Han: Wonderful girl. Either I'm gonna kill her, or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there.","Han: The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered. Let's get out of here. Get away from there.","Luke: No, wait. Forget it! I already tried it! It's magnetically sealed.","Leia: Put that thing away! You're gonna get us all killed!","Han: Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here. It's not gonna take 'em long to figure out what happened to us.","Leia: It could be worse.","Han: It's worse.","Luke: There's something alive in here.","Han: That's your imagination.","Luke: Something just moved past my leg. Look. Did you see that?","Han: What?","Han: Kid! Luke!","Leia: Grab hold of this!","Luke: Blast it! My gun's jammed.","Han: Where?","Luke: Anywhere!","Leia: Help him! What happened?","LukeI don't know. It just let go of me and disappeared.","Han: I got a bad feeling about this.","Leia: The walls are moving!","Leia: Don't just stand there. Try and brace it with something. Help me.","Luke: Wait a minute. 3PO! Come in, 3PO","Luke: 3PO? Where could he be?","Trooper: Take over. See to him. Look, there.","3PO: They're madmen. They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.","Trooper: Follow me. You stand guard.","3PO: Come on. All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.","Trooper: All right.","Luke: 3PO? Come in 3PO","Han: Get on top.","Leia: I can't.","Luke: Where could he be? 3PO.","3PO: They aren't here. Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry.","Han: One thing's for sure. We're all gonna be a lot thinner.","Han: Get on top of it.","Leia: I'm trying.","3PO: Thank goodness they haven't found them. Where could they be?",'3PO: "Use the comlink"? Oh, my. I forgot. I turned it off. Are you there, sir?',"Luke: 3PO?","3PO: We've had some problems.","Luke: Shut up and listen to me. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Do you copy?","Luke: Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level! Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level!","3PO: No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.","Luke: What? You did great, 3PO!","3PO: Listen to them. They're dying, R2. Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault. My poor master.","Luke: We're all right. You did great! Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... Where are we? 3263827","Han: If we can avoid any more female advice, we oughta be able to get out of here.","Luke: Let's get moving.","Han: Where you goin'?","Leia: Wait! They'll hear!","Han: Come here, you big coward. Chewie, come here.","Leia: Listen. I don't know who you are or where you came from... but from now on, you do as I tell you, okay?","Han: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person... me.","Leia: It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?","Han: No reward is worth this.","Trooper: Give me regular reports, please.","Trooper: Right.","Trooper: Do you know what's going on?","Trooper: Maybe it's another drill.","Trooper: You seen that new VT-16?","Trooper: Yeah. Some of the other guys were telling me about it.","Trooper: They say it's quite a thing to see.","Trooper: What was that?","Trooper: It's nothing. Outgassing. Don't worry about it.","Han: There she is.","Luke: C-3PO, do you copy?","3PO: Yes, sir.","Luke: Are you safe?","3PO: For the moment.","Luke: We're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by.","Leia: You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.","Han: Nice. Come on.","Trooper: It's them. Blast them.","Han: Get back to the ship!","Luke: Where are you going?","Leia: He certainly has courage.","Luke: What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on.","Luke: I think we took a wrong turn.","Leia: There's no lock.","Luke: That oughta hold them for a while.","Leia: Quick. We've got to get across. Find the controls to extend the bridge.","Luke: I think I just blasted it.","Leia: They're coming through.","Luke: Here, hold this.","Leia: Here they come.","Leia: For luck.","Trooper: We think they may be splitting up. They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.","3PO: Where could they be?","Trooper: Close the blast doors. Open the blast doors. Open the blast doors.","Vader: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again at last.","Vader: The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner. Now I am the master.","Obi-Wan: Only a master of evil, Darth.","Vader: Your powers are weak, old man.","Obi-Wan: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down... I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.","Vader: You should not have come back.","Han: Didn't we just leave this party?","Han: What kept you?","Leia: We ran into some old friends.","Luke: The ship all right?","Han: Seems okay, if we can get to it. I hope the old man got the tractor beam down.","Leia: Look.","3PO: Come on, R2. We're going.","Han: Now's our chance. Go!","Luke: No!","Han: Luke, come on!","Leia: Come on!","Luke, it's too late!","Blast the door, kid!","Run, Luke, run.","I hope that old man got the tractor beam down, or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it!","We're coming up on their sentry ships.","Hold them off. Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns.","I can't believe he's gone.","There wasn't anything you could have done.","Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet.","You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.","Here they come.","They're coming in too fast!","We've lost the lateral controls.","Don't worry. She'll hold together.","Hear me, baby? Hold together.","Got him. I got him!","Great, kid. Don't get cocky.","There's still two more.","That's it. We did it.","We did it.","Help. I think I'm melting.","This is all your fault.","Are they away?","They've just made the jump into hyperspace.","You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?","I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.","This had better work.","Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?","You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.","That doesn't sound too hard.","They let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.","You call that easy?","They're tracking us.","Not this ship, sister.","At least the information in R2 is still intact.","What's so important? What's he carrying?","The technical readouts of that battle station.","I only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found.","It's not over yet.","It is for me, sister.","I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.","I expect to be well paid.","I'm in it for the money.","You needn't worry about your reward.","If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive.","Your friend is quite a mercenary.","I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.","I care.","So...","what do you think of her, Han?","I'm trying not to, kid.","Good.","Still, she's got a lot of spirit.","What do you think?","You think a princess and a guy like me...","No.","You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.","We have no time for sorrows, Commander.","You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.","It's our only hope.","Yes.","We're approaching the planet Yavin.","The rebel base is on a moon on the far side.","We are preparing to orbit the planet.","The battle station is heavily shielded...","and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet.","Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.","A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.","Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters against that?","The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter to be any threat...","or they'd have a tighter defense.","An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia...","has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.","The approach will not be easy.","You're required to maneuver straight down this trench...","and skim the surface to this point.","The target area is only two meters wide.","It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port.","The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.","A precise hit will start a chain reaction...","which should destroy the station.","Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.","The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.","That's impossible, even for a computer.","No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home.","They're not much bigger than two meters.","Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you.","Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.","The moon with the rebel base will be in range in 30 minutes.","This will be a day long remembered.","It has seen the end of Kenobi...","and will soon see the end of the rebellion.","All flight crews, man your stations.","So, you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?","That's right. Yeah.","I got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff.","Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya?","Why don't you come with us?","You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.","Come on. Why don't you take a look around?","You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.","They could use a good pilot like you.","You're turning your back on them.","What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?","Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.","It's more like... suicide.","All right.","Well, take care of yourself, Han.","I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?","Hey, Luke.","May the Force be with you.","What are you looking at?","I know what I'm doing.","All pilots to your stations.","What's wrong?","It's Han.","I don't know.","I really thought he'd change his mind.","He's got to follow his own path.","No one can choose it for him.","I only wish Ben were here.","Open main launch tubes.","Main launch tubes opening, sir.","Hey, Luke!","Biggs!","I don't believe it. How are ya?","Coming up?","I'll be up there with you.","Have I got stories to tell you.","Skywalker.","Are you sure you can handle this ship?","Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories.","You'll do all right.","Thank you, sir. I'll try.","Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?","Hey, Biggs.","I told you I'd make it someday.","It'll be like old times, Luke.","They'll never stop us.","This R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up. You want a new one?","Not on your life.
